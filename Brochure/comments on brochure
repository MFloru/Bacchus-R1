##Comments on brochure




####Cover
An idea to put as text on the cover a while ago was the following :

edible insects (title)

an industry analysis report of mealworm flour (subtitle)

how Westerners can save the world by extending their diet with a healthy and delicious ingredient. (the short text at the corner leftunder)

Although I think that short text at the left corner does not exist anymore in this design of the report, I still believe the subtitle I propose here is better than the subtitle 'A focus on mealworms'


####Logic model + description

For me the logic model is very nice exept for one thing, I do not that like the box around input output and outcomes seems to have an extended heading in people.
Looks assymetric and it makes it unclear why we put the box.
Therefore, I propose to cut the connection between the grey of people and the grey of the rest, so you see people is apart.


####Backside tables
Typo : ecological aspect not aspet

Also, by reading the ecological graph carefully, I think it is a bit difficult to graps the information in the graph because it is so much information next to each other.
Moreover, the global warming potential graph does not really show an advantage of mealworms. Therefore, although we should include it in the body of the report, maybe better not in the overview where we want to convince people that it is worth reading our ideas.
I propose the following to make it clearer :
Do away with the global warming graph and put the energy use graph where the global warming graph is now. Then, put the legenda of the energy use graph next to the graph itself, now it was more difficult to see that they belong to each other.
Also, in the land use graph, use the same color for mealworm as in the energy use graph, because now the color for mealworm in the energy use graph is the color for beef in the land use graph, more difficult to understand.
