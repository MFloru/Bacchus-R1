Meeting Minutes
------
**Logic Model**

*Check it was put on the GMS 2015 repository under the _md format by Max*

*Create a Business Model Canvas (everybody has normally thought about it)*

*Discuss what to keep from 2 alternative versions of the logic model, check whether everybody understands the logic relationships*


**Use of Git**

*Do a short review of how far everybody is in the understanding of the use of Git*
Reference : the progit pdf. Chapter 1 & 2 for basics. 3 for a visual description of branching and 6 finally makes clear why it is useful to use Github.
- [ ] branching
- [ ] forking and pull request
- [ ] Atom
- [ ] markdown language

**Structure of the report**

*Matthias made a draft of a structure of the report. This can, next to the logic model, help to guide us to invest our time and resources wisely. Let's discuss about this draft and check how it fits with the work we already did and want to do.*

**Tasks Assignments for next week**

*Everybody read (potentially correct) and sign this minute meeting*

*Everybody looks at (and complete the agenda of) the next minute meeting*


*Brain-stormings over “Possible other markets” overviewed by Matthias (I don't think we need to do this) and maybe “Other industries we can use ideas from regarding the processing of crickets into flour” by Max. *

*Melinda and Max will design our Business Model Canvas*
