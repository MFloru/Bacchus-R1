Meeting Minutes
------
*Next meeting:  Monday April 20th, Ben Koo's office (Toy house), Shunde Building*

**News**
* Marie summarized all the mealworms information in the FAO report (see corresponding files on Teambition and GitHub) and explained what she did to the team

**Discussions**
* Preparation of Ben Koo meeting (structure of our report, ways of gathering information)
* Questions to ask: 
*What's the format for references (in markdown)*
*How is our current report organization? Shall we merge it with parts ideas from the FAO report?*
*Is our logic model ok or shall we improve it again? If so, how?*
*Timeline?*
*Any (other) advices?*

* Discussion about the coming of iPodia students (project suggested by Echo).
*We think we should take 15 minutes during next class to ask people their ideas. It is unlikely that we will have much time to spend in the party organization*

* Discussion over what will come next

**Tasks**
* Iker investigates the references specifically targetted to mealworms tracked down by Marie
* Marie puts in the draft of our report what she found on the FAO report (under list form) and potentially make organization changes
* Melinda continues looking for data of competitors
* Matthias still looks at the market size, comparable industries and ways to grow mealworms by ourselves
* Max continues his investigations on industrialization process
