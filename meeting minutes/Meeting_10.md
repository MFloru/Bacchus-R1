Meeting Minutes
------
*Next meeting:  Wednesday April 22nd, Teaching Building 6*

**News**

**Questions to Ben Koo and Echo**

*What's the format for references (in markdown)*
* There is no specific markdown code for it. Just import it from Word and put the authors in bold letters
* We should have a look at "Cite this for me" my website

*How is our current report organization? Shall we merge it with parts ideas from the FAO report?*
*Is our logic model ok or shall we improve it again? If so, how?*
* At the moment; we shall first focus on the design. Content seems good so far.

**Discussions**

*Mainly about the layout of our report as our content is ok so far*

* Presentation of our 10 to 20 pages PDF-document design to the class on next Wednesday !
* We shall have a condensed index page with everything in it (cf picture of the example Melinda took)
* We shall build a table of contents corresponding to our chosen layout (policies, sizes, colors of healines...). This will help us knowing what we what to have exactly in the end
* We must put pictures and diagrams
* Overview page(s): we will need to make something very graphic (word-could page with big white insects to write down general information, world map(s) with data on it)
* We shall need to address the 4 forces (Matthias shall correct the structure of the report accordingly)
* We shall add some content related to our reading assignements (namely Clockspeed and 3T) and add references towards it

*Other*

* We shall have to make our topic more globalized, studying the legislation on goods transportation across countries (import/export)

* Discussion about the coming of iPodia students (project suggested by Echo).

*We think we should take 15 minutes during next class to ask people their ideas. It is unlikely that we will have much time to spend in the party organization*

**Tasks TO HAVE COMPLETED BY NEXT WEDNESDAY**
* Everybody puts the relevant data for Melinda on a specific Teambition file (the first who wants to use it creates it)
* Melinda prepares the layout of our report (under Word?): headlines (green?) + cover page + 1-page summary (cf picture she took) + table of contents + general format for our diagrams + references with a column for QR codes (provided by Marie & Iker) + possibly, a page with big white insects so that we can add general data on it.
* Iker checks and makes QR codes out of Marieâ€™s references from FAO report (target the most important ones, maybe?) + pictures + diagrams numbers (?) and adds them on the Teambition file
* Matthias corrects the current template adding parts about the 4 forces (law, technology, market analysis, norm-culture) + looks for pictures and add them on the Teambition file
* Marie reads and adds content about the Clockspeed and 3T and add the part in the GitHub draft.

**Extra reading recommendation**
* Free software, Free society, by Richard Stallman
