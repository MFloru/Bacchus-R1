Meeting Minutes
------
*Next meeting: next Friday at 4:15PM*

**News**

* Matthias printed the insects as food and feed safety report
* The contact from Tiny farm states that the cost of insect production is currently too high because most of the process in manual labour.

**Logic Model**

* The current version will be posted soon by Max on the GMS 2015 (to check)

*Rework on the logic model so that there really are causes and effects (from the end to the beginning)*

*Create a Business Model Canvas (everybody has normally thought about it)*

*Discuss what to keep from 2 alternative versions of the logic model, check whether everybody understands the logic relationships*

=> These three last tasks are postponed to when we have further advanced into our topic definition

**Discussions**

* Cricket flour seems not to fit that much because it is not nutritionally speaking the best insect nor the most eaten worldwide.

* Two alternate possibilities to investigate 

*Beetles? No company in the West do that already*

*Mealworms? There is an available online kit to breed it so we can grow them easily. Then we might improve it.*

*Questions to answer: Can we convert it in flour? Cycle time? Health impacts? So that we can make a comparison with crickets.*

* Health risks overview (Marie): allergy to insects, digestibility of chtinine, exposition to pesticides, micro-organisms

* Industries overview (Matthias): focused on alternative meats, 4 billion $ market worldwide, and pet food already developed (a company in China produces 20 000 tons of insects to feed Western fish)

**Use of Git**

*Short review of how far everybody is in the understanding of the use of Git*

Reference : the progit pdf. Chapter 1 & 2 for basics. 3 for a visual description of branching and 6 finally makes clear why it is useful to use Github.
- [ ] branching
- [ ] forking and pull request
- [ ] Atom
- [ ] markdown language

*We shall prepare to train so that we are able to merge our files when we shall actually work on the report (in markdown)*
*We’ll have to  work on the file on our own computer and push it to avoid conflicts*
*Do not put pictures yet, but make a link towards teambition*
*Similarly, for data word files data, put it on teambition*

**Structure of the report**

*Matthias made a draft of a structure of the report. This can, next to the logic model, help to guide us to invest our time and resources wisely. Let's discuss about this draft and check how it fits with the work we already did and want to do.*

**Tasks Assignments for next week**

* Everybody read (potentially correct) and sign this minute meeting
* Everybody look at (and complete the agenda of) the next minute meeting
* Everybody read and improve Matthias’s proposition for an alternative logic model on our Git repo.
* Everybody read chapters 3 and 6 of pro-git manual and learns about merging
* Everybody download Atom *

* Iker makes a research on developing time, protein content of mealworm
* Melinda makes a research on developing time, protein content of beetles
* Marie starts writing on key drivers to grow the insect industry
* Max thinks about a very general process for insects
* Max posts our logic model on GMS2015
* Matthias continues
