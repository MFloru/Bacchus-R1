Meeting Minutes
------
*Next meeting: Wednesday 20, 9AM, Teaching Building 6 (to be confirmed)*

**News**

* Coming of iPodia students on the next 2 week classes

**Discussions**

* Point on our advances

* Logic Model => reviewed

We will have to present the logic model in class. So we should get a good understanding of it, iterate on it and improve it and design it as a visual and catchy thing.

An idea is to make, next to the complete model, a shorter model highlighting the most important parts with imagery and logos etc. Important is that this shorter version looks good on one slide in a ppt.

* Business Model Canvas => Postponed

Finally, the time has come to make a business model canvas. It can be added in the last part of the report serving as a visualization of the things we recommend a starting company in this field to think about. 

* Teambition homework:
* List of meaningful variables to see if our hoped outcomes actually happen:
Law: how many countries have a law on edible insects? (0 at the moment) Has a text of law been released at the European Union / United States Congress level?
Technology: What's the production cost of one kilogram of edible insect?
Norm (measure of acceptance): Number of restaurants cooking edible insects? Track how many people typed "edible insects" or "mealworms" or other related words on Google
Markets: statistics on this market become available; market share and volume.

* Process Data of your team on Github.com and Teambition
* Create a static webpage on Github.com, and use Layar technology (Augmented Reality Technology shown by Hester's team) to refer to that Github.com page by Wednesday. If you have any technical problem, please try to get help from other teams that has this skill.
* Print out a single page brochure ï¼ˆincluding team name, project description, cover design and the logic model) that contains the QR code or the Layar registration image , and print at least 5 copies to be distributed to other teams in the classroom.

* Institionalize the accessibility of the last version of the design of the full report by everyone.

* Check of tasks: everybody presents the progress in his or her tasks.
