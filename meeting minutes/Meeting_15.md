Meeting Minutes
------
*Next meeting: Wednesday 20, 9AM, Teaching Building 6*

**News**

* Coming of iPodia students on the next 2 week classes

**Discussions**

* Point on our advances

* Logic Model

We will have to present the logic model in class. So we should get a good understanding of it, iterate on it and improve it and design it as a visual and catchy thing.

An idea is to make, next to the complete model, a shorter model highlighting the most important parts with imagery and logos etc. Important is that this shorter version looks good on one slide in a ppt.

* Business Model Canvas

Finally, the time has come to make a business model canvas. It can be added in the last part of the report serving as a visualization of the things we recommend a starting company in this field to think about. Matthias will prepare it by Sunday, we can discuss it then.

*Prepare everything that is inside the last post on teambition of the professor - a lot! Here's a reminder:

1. Please prepare a slide of your refined Logic Model, a list of variables you are collecting for your IAR, and the Process Data of your team on Github.com and Teambition, and show them on Wednesday.

2. Create a static webpage on Github.com, and use Layar technology (Augmented Reality Technology shown by Hester's team) to refer to that Github.com page by Wednesday. If you have any technical problem, please try to get help from other teams that has this skill.

3. Print out a single page brochure ï¼ˆincluding team name, project description, cover design and the logic model) that contains the QR code or the Layar registration image , and print at least 5 copies to be distributed to other teams in the classroom.

* Institionalize the accessibility of the last version of the design of the full report by everyone.
