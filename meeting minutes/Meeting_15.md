Meeting Minutes

*Next meeting: Wednesday 20, 9AM, Teaching Building 6*

**News**


* Point on our advances

**Discussions**

* Logic Model

We will have to present the logic model in class. So we should get a good understanding of it, iterate on it and improve it and design it as a visual and catchy thing.

An idea is to make, next to the complete model, a shorter model highlighting the most important parts with imagery and logos etc. Important is that this shorter version looks good on one slide in a ppt.

* Business Model Canvas

Finally, the time has come to make a business model canvas. It can be added in the last part of the report serving as a visualization of the things we recommend a starting company in this field to think about. Matthias will prepare it by Sunday, we can discuss it then.

*Prepare everything that is inside the last post on teambition of the professor - a lot!

*Institionalize the accessibility of the last version of the design of the full report by everyone.

* Check of tasks

Everybody presents the progress in his or her tasks. Marie subdivides her tasks. New deadlines should be set.

**Tasks**

* See Melinda's Excel
