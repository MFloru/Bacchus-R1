Meeting Minutes
------
*Next meeting: ??, Building 20 4th floor*

**Discussions**

* Point on our IAR progress and organization

* what are we still going to change and what not? Especially in law (write about how current startups are coping with the lawless zone) and technology part (is rather short, could use the process scheme we used in the slides and could give a more visual overview of the different steps), possibly also in supply chain part (blockchain can be better explained with help of Jonathan)

* are the tasks of last week done?

* better not everybody to proofread : too much work + annoying for Melinda, how to divide?



**Taking pictures**


**Tasks**

* Someone implementing all qr codes

* everybody write something about themselves

* Someone making a list of all insect food companies (their website link)

* Someone responsible to check all references that are inside the report (when they are put inside)
