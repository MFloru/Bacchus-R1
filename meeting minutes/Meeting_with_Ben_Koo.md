Meeting Minutes
------
**Pre-meeting remarks**

* Logic model: put a half centimeter space not to lose any content
* Everybody has to think about one or two main sources he/she used in his/her part
* we’ll have to change some graphs on the double-page: world map

**Ben KOO’s remarks**

* Likes our report so far
* We must know what an IAR is and how to do it

1)	Collect data and define the key purposes
Outline

2)	1st section: Investigate this particular field, establish the credibility (verification of the sources; methodology)

3)	2nd part: analysis, given the previous research => people should have sufficient knowledge to make decisions from our IAR

4)	3rd section: Forming opinion, a message to people

* Potato, change the picture to put an insect
* Put our references in an appendix in the end with the principal references, and a QR Code to less important ones listed in a website. 
For the video: a link is ok if it is not crucial. Otherwise, put it in a platform (use a VPN to put it on Youtube) and add it.
* no need to have a formal conclusion
* Add one page with the process data and how the work has been done

**MIT Bitcoin club president’s remarks**

* People started using Bitcoin blockchain technology for logistics.
* Possibility to create a local blockchain, just inside the company 
* Possibility to program automatically the movement of mealworms in the world (if they die in a place)
* Possibility to use it on captors for temperature and humidity (all this data will be organized and saved. Then we can pull it to optimize the growth of mealworms). 
* Keep tracks of the farms around/your own
