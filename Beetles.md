|**Beetles** |

*I was looking for the way to rearing beetles, the life cycle and the nutrition. beetles have a lot of species, therefore the information is also vary.*
*I also google the advantages of beetle as a food, and there's no many suggestion about that.*

*Conclusion: I'm not suggesting to go with beetles*

|* Life Cycle of the Beetles:*|
-------------------------------------------
|*Egg Incubation: 	3-5 weeks, 10 eggs/day*|
|*Larvae:	7-10 days*|
|*Pupa:	6-18 days*|
|*Beetle: 8-12 weeks*|

|*Nutritional Facts:*|
---------------------------------------------
*Beetles are among the richest insect sources of protein, according to National Geographic, but the exact amount depends on what type of beetle you're eating. A giant water beetle, for example, supplies about 20 grams of protein per 3.5-ounce, serving while the same amount of June beetle supplies 13.4. A serving of palmworm beetle can have as much as 36 grams of protein. Like other insects, beetles supply calcium and iron, as well as a good dose of zinc. The exact amounts depend on the size and variety of beetle you're eating.*

*but roughly speaking, the nutrition content in each type of beetle are:*
*Dung beetle: 17.2 grams protein, 4.3 grams fat, 0.2 grams carbohydrate*
*Giant water beetle: 19.8 grams protein, 8.3 grams fat, 2.1 grams carbohydrate*
*June beetle: 13.4 grams protein, 1.4 grams fat, 2.9 grams carbohydrate*
