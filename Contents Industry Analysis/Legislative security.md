**Legislative security**

*In general this is written very well, I like the clear style! However, we should be somewhat shorter on europe and add a paragraph about america.*

In many countries, there is no regulation for insects as food and feed. This is one of the big barriers to insect mass-production. *Add 2 sentences or so about why this is a barrier (I guess because of the high risk for companies to operate in a grey lawless environment resulting in potential buyers and sellers who do not want to participate in the market? e.g. a startup produces insects and wants to sell them to a supermarketchain but that chain cannot take the risk to buy such food)* There are no international guidelines provided by the Codex Alimentarius (a database providing international reference standards for food and feed) either. On the opposite, there are laws on maximum permissive levels of insect contamination in food products for humans such as grains (FAO, 2013).

In EU, edible insects are considered as Novel Food because they were not consumed to a significant degree by Europeans before May 15, 1997. Therefore, the European Novel Food Regulation (EC n° 258/97) should apply, restricting their trade as long as their safety has not been investigated (European Parliament, 1997).

The European Commission is currently financing a scientific study in partnership with China plus other countries in Europe and Africa that aims at better evaluate the potential health risks and advantages of edible insects. It will be finished by April 30th 2016. (PROTEINSECT, 2015). One might hope that its completion will accelerate the trade authorization of edible insects for human consumption in the European market. A hope sustained by the coming revision of the Novel Food regulation planned in 2016.

*this paragraph about France does not belong here. I will add one sentence in the paragraph about Belgium and Holland to replace this paragraph. A more detailed discussion of the report by the sanitation agencies of belgium, france and possibly other can be included in the law section of our IAR.*

A report from the French national sanitary agency ANSES was released in February 2015 (ANSES, 2015). Although it asks for further investigation on health risk of insects in its conclusions, it still represents a step forward in the legalization of edible insects’ trade and consumption in France.

*Remark: Another project involving the European Commission called “DESIRABLE” aims at evaluating the potential of insects as biomass converters by rearing them on waste. However, in virtue of regulations (EC) n°1069/2009 and (EC) n°767/2009 forbidding animal to be raised on kitchen wastes and manure, it is unlikely that this research project will lead to applications in actual production (ANSES, 2015).*

*I think you should put this remark inside and conclude it with a sentence that freeing up this regulation will unlock a vast potential of biowaste reduction and animal feed production.*

The interpretation of this European Novel Food Regulation (EC n° 258/97) is somewhat ambiguous. Insects as human food are partly –and always unofficially– tolerated in countries where legislation is unclear, like in France or the UK (Day, 2015). At the moment it is up to each state-member to decide for itself on specific cases.

In Spain for example, insects are allowed to be eaten in restaurants who buy them for foreign suppliers, but not to be sold for consumption. Health authorities vetoed indeed an edible insect shop in Barcelona in 2008. (Benítez, 2013).

On the other hand, Belgium became the first European country authorizing 10 species to be commercialized in December 2013 (Flanders Today, 2014). The Netherlands also have a very permissive attitude towards insects.*Add a source about the netherlands(if needed, I can look for that in the dutch language) ANSES, the French national sanitary agency, recently released a report advancing the legalization of edible insects’ trade and consumption in France(ANSES, 2015).*

*Find data about the situation in America and add a paragraph about that here. I believe in America the situation is pretty much the same as in Europe, with probably no national law but some states where some law is put in place.*

The situation is very likely to evolve in the coming years.
