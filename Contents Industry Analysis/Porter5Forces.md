Buyer Power:

-	The buyers can buy either bulk size  or retail size
-	The primary channel for buyers is web stores
-	The buyers are not sensitive to high prices (gourmet/innovative food) 
*True for current buyers, but we'll have more if we can lower the price I think. Is this really a Buyer Power?*
-	The product offered is different (transparent processes)
*What do you mean?*
-	The buyers can change to other distributors

Supplier Power:

-	Human consumption level suppliers are few (less than 50 worldwide) 
-	There size of the suppliers is small to medium (less than 50  employees)
-	There are a couple of similar products (buffalo worm , soldier fly larvae) 
*I'd rather put that in the substitutes*
-	The product can be breed by customers
*I'd rather put that in the competitive rivalry*

Competitive Rivalry

-	Not many competitors
-	Innovative products
-	Low customer loyalty *It rather belongs to Buyer Power in my opinion, no?*
-	Small target market *Same, I don't know if it goes in this part but I don't see where to put it*


Threat of Substitution:

-	Soy produced food is already positioned in market *I'd put that in Competitive Rivalry*
-	Soy produced food has no negative social acceptance factor *I'd combine that with the first line*
-	Plant made food is already highly available as substitute *Do you mean vegetable food?!*
-	Substitute products price tag is high *What does "price tag" mean?*

Threat of New Entry:

-	Pet consumption level producers are moderate-high (less than 200 worldwide)
-	Pet consumption level producers can adjust their processes and produce human consumption level products
-	The product difficulty is low, competitors can be set up overnight
-	There is no brand recognition yet
-	Processes are easily replicable
-	No patents held
