Buyer Power:

ACTUALLY 2 OPTIONS : we supply the end consumer or we make the mealworm flour and sell that to endproduct companies, take that into account.

-	The buyers can buy either bulk size  or retail size
-	The primary channel for buyers is web stores
-	The buyers are not sensitive to high prices (gourmet/innovative food)
*(True for current buyers, but we'll have more if we can lower the price I think. Is this really a Buyer Power?*
**It is a buyer power as they dont focus on cheap prices, but good quality (gourmet or innovative). The buyer pays more but expects more**

Watch out, the buyer is not not sensitive to high prices but less sensitive. Expensive food products can never reach a huge market.
-	Low customer loyalty *It rather belongs to Buyer Power in my opinion, no?* **Yes**
-	The product can be breed by customers
*I'd rather put that in the competitive rivalry* **After reviewing I decided to place it to Consumer Power, as if they are not satisfied with the available products, they could breed their own**

Supplier Power:

2 OPTIONS : we produce the mealworm flour, then we have no suppliers, or we buy from mealworm farms
think about milk ibdustry!!

-	Human consumption level suppliers are few (less than 50 worldwide)
-	There size of the suppliers is small to medium (less than 50  employees)
-	There are a couple of similar products (buffalo worm , soldier fly larvae)
*I'd rather put that in the substitutes* **buffalo worm and soldier fly are basically the same, vegan products and soy meat are substitutes--- Small example: Coke, sprite and Fanta are soda beverages; Iced tea and Fruit juice are substite **

Competitive Rivalry

-	Not many competitors
-	Innovative products
-	Small target market
-	The product offered is different (transparent processes)
*What do you mean?*
**We talk tomorrow about this, is basically our main difference against other distributors**

Threat of Substitution:

-	Soy produced food is already positioned in market *I'd put that in Competitive Rivalry* **Soy products are substitutes, Competitive Rivalry focus on our market, not substitute markets**
-	Soy produced food has no negative social acceptance factor *I'd combine that with the first line* **Different arguments, better to keep them in different lines**
-	Plant made food is already highly available as substitute *Do you mean vegetable food?!* **I mean vegan-grade products, like beef made with mushrooms powder, duck meat made with algae and aubergine, etc, etc**
-	Substitute products price tag is high *What does "price tag" mean?* **Its a fancy way of saying is expensive**

Threat of New Entry:

-	Pet consumption level producers are moderate-high (less than 200 worldwide)
-	Pet consumption level producers can adjust their processes and produce human consumption level products
-	The product difficulty is low, competitors can be set up overnight
-	There is no brand recognition yet
-	Processes are easily replicable
-	No patents held
