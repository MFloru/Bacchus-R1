**Acceptance among Western people to eat insects**

*complete references saved as such in the Word file*

*starting bluntly with stating that there is disgust seems too straightforward. I would add a couple of sentences about this acceptance and why it is important, for example(first draft): A key challenge towards selling insects for human consumption will be people in the West accepting insects as a food source or not. A better understanding of why most people do not like insects nowadays can help finding creative solutions to make people accept insects*

*=> agreed! I made minor modifications to your sentence:*

A key challenge towards selling insects for human consumption will be people in the West accepting insects as a food source. A better understanding of why most Westerners do not like the idea of eating insects nowadays (FAO, 2013) can indeed help finding creative solutions to improve global insects acceptance.

Let us put the currently observed Western disgust towards insect consumption  in a historical prospect.

*next to historical, should we also add the global context here, namely 2 billion non westerners eating insects around the world?*
*=>Didn't we already talk about it in the introduction? I fear there will be too many repetitions. But I can put it i the first sentence if needs be*

Agriculture was born in the Fertile Crescent, a region located in western Asia, ten thousand years ago before quickly spread to Europe. From a nomad hunter-gatherer way of life, men started to domesticate plant and animals to secure their food sources, thus became sedentary (Henry, 1997).

The domesticated animals were mainly large ones, not only because they were present in these regions but also because they could supply wool, leather, warmth, milk and strength (for farming or transportation) in addition to meat; what insects cannot. Moreover, the seasonality of insects -especially in these non-tropical regions where most of them hibernate- added to the uncertainty of their supply made them an unreliable source of food for Westerners, and especially urban areas.

In parallel, along with the plant domestication, insects became a pest able to destroy entire harvests. This is one of the reasons why Westerners culturally associate all insects with nuisances. Examples such as mosquitos, ticks, fleas or flies able to transmit illnesses to humans; or termites eating the wood of their constructions only deepened Westerners’ aversion against insects. Not to mention the shapes of insects, seen as monstrous and repulsive by many a European.

Westerners also rapidly associated insect consumption with some primitive and therefore contemptible behavior inherited from the hunting-gathering times; forgetting pleasantly that the Greeks and Romans themselves ate insects in ancient times (DeFoliard, 1999)

*what is despicable behaviour? could you change it to an easier wording? =>Ok. I hope "contemptible" is easier to understand; I've changed it*

Because of this historical and cultural background, disgust is the first reaction of many a European when suggested to eat insects. But just as every social norm, it can be changed within some time.

Indeed, some encouraging experiments carried out in Belgium (Rudy Caparros Megido, 2014) showed that on 105 respondents from both genders and different ages, although 46.6% of them had a negative attitude towards it; 77.7% of them were willing to try insects. This demonstrates curiosity and desire to try novel food.

Besides, several initiatives such as the “Pestaurant” events in the UK (Rentokil) aim at promoting Western consumption of insects. As another evidence of their growing popularity, more and more restaurants cooking insects open their doors in the Western countries (Insect Europe).

*I rewrote your paragraph a bit, I think this wording is more aligned with our goal of promoting acceptance.*

*Besides, the popularity of insect tasting events such as “Pestaurant” in the UK (Rentokil) shows a growing interest of Western people in eating insects. Even more encouraging, more and more restaurants cooking insects open their doors in the Western countries (Insect Europe).*

*Now I think we can delete all the comments under this one as I think the text of this part is ready*

*one encouraging experiment seems not enough to convince me when I read this, so would be good to have 3 of them. A good one is this one : a pop up restaurant in london serving insects, and they have data on how much was consumed. http://www.rentokil.co.uk/pestaurant/ another example is that insects are sold in supermarkets in Belgium these days(we have already links about that.) Also possible is to draw a parallel to sushi, apparently was sushi regarded as disgusting 30 years ago in USA and Europe*

*=>I found a link towards a non-exhaustive list of restaurants that serve insects in Europe and North-America and put it there as well as your Rentokil initiative example. I think the study I used is good already because it is really scientific*
