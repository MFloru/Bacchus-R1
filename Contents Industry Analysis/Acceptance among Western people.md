Let us put the currently observed Western disgust towards insect consumption  (FAO, 2013) in a historical prospect.

Agriculture was born in the Fertile Crescent, a region located in western Asia, ten thousand years ago before quickly spread to Europe. From a nomad hunter-gatherer way of life, men started to domesticate plant and animals to secure their food sources, thus became sedentary (Henry, 1997).

The domesticated animals were mainly large ones, not only because they were present in these regions but also because they could supply wool, leather, warmth, milk and strength (for farming or transportation) in addition to meat; what insects cannot. Moreover, the seasonality of insects -especially in these non-tropical regions where most of them hibernate- added to the uncertainty of their supply made them an unreliable source of food for Westerners, and especially urban areas.

In parallel, along with the plant domestication, insects became a pest able to destroy entire harvests. This is one of the reasons why Westerners culturally associate all insects with nuisances. Examples such as mosquitos, ticks, fleas or flies able to transmit illnesses to humans; or termites eating the wood of their constructions only deepened Westernersâ€™ aversion against insects. Not to mention the shapes of insects, seen as monstrous and repulsive by many a European.

Westerners also rapidly associated insect consumption with some primitive therefore despicable behavior inherited from the hunting-gathering times; forgetting pleasantly that the Greeks and Romans themselves ate insects in ancient times (DeFoliard, 1999)

Because of this historical and cultural background, disgust is the first reaction of many a European when suggested to eat insects. But just as every social norm, it can be changed within some time.
Indeed, some encouraging experiments carried out in Belgium (Rudy Caparros Megido, 2014) showed that on 105 respondents from both genders and different ages, although 46.6% of them had a negative attitude towards it; 77.7% of them were willing to try insects. This demonstrates curiosity and desire to try novel food.
