###Research Methodology

We should not forget to add a part about research methodology. First we dedicate a part about our logic model.

Afterwards, we can talk about 2 things :

1 the kind of resources we have used (similar to one of our PPTs :  video's from TED, BBC, articles out of research journals, reports, media articles, law excerpts...)

2 how we approached the report : not only focussing on insects itself, as this would make it a narrow report not preparing for the real world : highly insecure and changing. Therefore, we also did a lot of research about frameworks, strategies, market environments, current trends in technology...

We conclude with explaining how and where they can find all our references : the important ones with qr codes in the text, all the rest grouped per chapter following scientific referencing.

Then, the visual eyecatcher : a textbox with the 10 references that helped us the most and we recommend to everyone who starts an insect company. For every reference, we have a name, description and link.

Everybody can add references here when you think they belong in that box : (I already added some, off course these are proposals, in the end we can decide which ones reallt belong inside)

**FAO report** : the startpoint for everything you want to know about insects for feed and food.

**Code, Lessig** : his 4 forces : law and technology, norm and market give a framework to understand the complex environment in which you start a company

**an awesome TED talk/BBC video** : I didn't watch many of them, but we should find the best one in convincing people insects are the future.

**Tiny Farms** : A company in California with the goal of industrializing insects. The numerous articles about them and the personal contact we had with them gave us some insight in the insect industry. Also, they have an open source platform about insect farming, a useful resource for a starting insect farmer.

** Clockspeed & 3D concurrent Engineering, Fine** : Make sure you design your supply chain strategically or you will never seize a market. This book gives a tool and framework for that.
