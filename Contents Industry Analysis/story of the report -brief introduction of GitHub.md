The story of this report

Everything started in the Global Manufacturing Strategy class of the English Master in Management Science and Engineering Program of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. We were required to write an IAR, shortcut for the so-called “Industrial Analysis report”.

Our multinational team was brought together by our love of food. The choice of the specific topic of edible insects came quickly, as a very promising alternative of meat. The original idea was to investigate cricket flour as it was becoming famous in Western countries. However, after we got more familiar with the edible insects world, it turned out that cricket might not be the best choice. After further investigations, we decided to shift our main focus on mealworms. 

In order to complete this work, we did not only meet very frequently but also used online collaborative tools such as GitHub (a platform where you can creat a repository where commitments from team-members can be tracked, merged and modified; visitors are also able to leave modification suggestions) and Teambition (a super DropBox with an additive blog function and organizational tool).

As a way of illustration, here is a graph of our team-member’s contributions on GitHub along the length of the project.
