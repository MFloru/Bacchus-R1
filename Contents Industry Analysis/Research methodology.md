###Research Methodology

This Industry Analysis Report is made by 5 graduate students at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. It serves as the capstone of the Global Manufacturing Strategy course, following the XLP teaching methodology (Xtreme Learning Proces) and taught by professor Ben Koo.

*add the XLP logo*

Instead of the common passive lecture teaching method, the course forces students to take the lead themselves. The professor institutes the rules and laws of the course, a marketplace for exchanging ideas and progress, a norm of open discussion based on extensive readings and the tools or technology for collaboration and coordination of the 21st century. The rest is up to the teams themselves.

Up to today, already a lot of research papers are published about insects as a food source. Also, startup companies are trying out business models for this new food source. So far, no industry analysis report has been published about this new industry field. We link academic research with the business done today and compress it in an easy to read assessment and guideline for stakeholders in this new industry. With this work, we hope to advance the growth of the insect industry.

One katalysator for structuring the project and comparing goals to actual achievements is the logic model. We presented our logic model as one of the first things in this report, as it shows the reader what our goals are and how we achieve them. For us, during the project, the logic model served as a reference to make sure the work we did was helping towards our end goals.

Within the framework of the logic model, a continuous effort is done to back up the report with reliable data.To do that, a various amount of sources has been collected. Different parts required different sources. The most important resource is the report "Edible insects: future prospects for food and feed security", published in 2013 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2013. This extensive report is the first thing everybody who wants to start in the insect industry should read.
To get an overview of the state of the insect industry today, traditional international media was consulted, such as Fortune, Huffington Post or BBC. In addition, new media, such as blogs of people active in the insect community, provided useful insights. Moreover, e-mail conversations with companies active in the field gave us an idea of the current issues they are facing.
Data about nutritional content, health issues, environmental impact and come from academic research in the recent field of entomophagy. For the market study, we used estimates of market analysts.

Only looking at what is going on in the insect industry and research right now is not enough. It is still a new field, risky and changing. Focusing on insects alone would not prepare companies for the real world. Therefore, we also looked to the outside. We did research about frameworks, strategies, market environments and current trends in technology. Management science became the backbone of the report, helping us to asses the challenges and possibilities of this new industry.

Our references are an important part of the project. They are accessible in different ways. First, the most important references have a QR code attached to it in the text. Therefore, it is easy to access them if you want to know more. Furthermore, all the cited references are grouped per chapter at the end of the report, following scientific referencing. In addition, online, we provide a list of links to all the references we used to form an idea of the insect industry, also the non directly cited ones. And on the next page, we provide you with a list of our 10 most important references, to give you the possibilities for further reading at a glance.

**FAO report** : the startpoint for everything you want to know about insects for feed and food.

**Code, Lessig** : his 4 forces : law and technology, norm and market give a framework to understand the complex environment in which you start a company. We based the structure of our report on his work.

####old draft version

We should not forget to add a part about research methodology. First we dedicate a part about our logic model.

We should here also include the structure of our report, and that it is based on lessigs code.

Afterwards, we can talk about 2 things :

1 the kind of resources we have used (similar to one of our PPTs :  video's from TED, BBC, articles out of research journals, reports, media articles, law excerpts...)

2 how we approached the report : not only focussing on insects itself, as this would make it a narrow report not preparing for the real world : highly insecure and changing. Therefore, we also did a lot of research about frameworks, strategies, market environments, current trends in technology...

We conclude with explaining how and where they can find all our references : the important ones with qr codes in the text, all the rest grouped per chapter following scientific referencing.

Then, the visual eyecatcher : a textbox with the 10 references that helped us the most and we recommend to everyone who starts an insect company. For every reference, we have a name, description and link.

Everybody can add references here when you think they belong in that box : (I already added some, off course these are proposals, in the end we can decide which ones reallt belong inside)
