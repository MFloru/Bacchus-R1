*World Hunger should as said before, not be seen as the most important driver but as one of the drivers. I think it is a good idea of Melinda to put it in a box apart instead of leaving this part out, so I will try to add some improvements with that in mind - Matthias*

<h2 id="-edible-insects-"><em>The World Hunger</em></h2>

*I think the title 'the world hunger' is very offensive and associates the reader with bad thoughts. An alternative could be : 'Can we feed the world?'*

*Start with a paragraph about a growing world population + the amount of extra food needed to support that, based on the UN forecast (9 billion people in 2050) Read for this the style of the foreword of the FAO report on edible insects*

<p>In this modern era, hunger kills more people every year than AIDS, malaria, & tuberculosis combined (World Food Programme, 2015).
As world hunger refers to the want or scarcity of food in a country (Oxford English Dictionary, 1971),
*leave out the sentence defining world hunger in the dictionary, this does not add much*
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about 805 million people of the 7.3 billion people in the world were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2012-2014. That means 1 in 9 people were suffering from that (World Hunger,2015). </p>
<p>Regardless of the decreasing number of hungry people that can be seen in the table presented above, world hunger is still a major issue that needs special attention. There are lots of things that people have done to help reduce the number. Most of them are by increasing the production rate in agriculture sector.</p>
<p>However, is it true that the main reason of world hunger is because of we don’t grow enough food to feed everyone? It turns out the growth of global agriculture’s productive potential has so far been more than sufficient to exceed population growth (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2012). The reason of the world hunger is mostly because of poverty, because the poor people can’t afford the food.
The dependence of agriculture source of food is what makes the distribution of food produced uneven.*what's the meaning of this sentence?* Therefore, we need a new source of food that is reliable to support; or even better – substitute the common source of food.</p>

*I rewrote the last 2 paragraphs partly in order to make them stronger in supporting our argument and making them more clear to read. However, I leave the original ones as well so you can compare and see what is better and what is not better in my version*

*Regardless of the decreasing number of hungry people that can be seen in the table presented above, world hunger is still a major issue. For example, Europeans see poverty, hunger and the lack of drinking water as the biggest problem in the world.

Humanity is constantly making progress towards reducing the number of hungry people in the world. Most of this progress happens by increasing the production rate in the agriculture sector.*

*However, is it true that the main reason for hunger is that we don’t grow enough food to feed everyone? It turns out that the growth of the global agricultural productive potential has so far been more than sufficient to exceed population growth (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2012). It is because poor people, especially in 3rd world countries, cannot afford the food they need, that world hunger is such a big issue. Meat, one of the most important sources for necessary proteins, is in most poor households a scarcely eaten product. The vast amount of resources needed to produce meat makes it too expensive.
Therefore, we need a new source of food that is reliable to support; or even better – substitute today's food sources.*


<h3 id="Why-insect">Why Insect</h3>
<p>From that concern we are fascinated with the idea of insect as a new-reliable source of food. This idea is also supported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, as quoted from bbc.com said that eating insect could help boost nutrition and reduce pollution; thus eating more insect could help fight world hunger (BBC, 2013). </p>
<p>As we know that consuming insect is still an unpopular idea especially in western country, a further exploration about edible insect will be a good call as it will provide more information and people will get to know it better.  </p>

*I would leave away the first 2 paragraphs to make this text more catchy and convincing. The first paragraph because world hunger is not the main point we want to show our consumers. However, the links to UN FAO and BBC can be used in an improved version of paragraph 3. Paragraph 3 is very good but should be written with some more links and facts proving what you are saying. Paragraph 2 can be left out because we will talk about that in the part about key drivers for insects, right after the introduction.*

*Alternative starting paragraph : In 2013, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (reference) published a report urging us to start eating insects in order to fight world hunger. European hipsters in cities such as Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and London start embracing insects as a delicous snack. American startup companies are looking into new ways to produce insects for food. Is this a temporary hype or will this trend lead to a Western society in which eating insects is as normal as going to McDonalds? This is a question this industry analysis report will try to answer. Moreover, we compose a framework to evaluate the insect for food business and will include strategies to tap into this new field. We want to become a reference for everybody, from startups to investors, researchers to big companies, who is looking into insects for food from a business viewpoint. But first of all, why, among all possible food sources, why do we choose for these crawling animals most people hate? *

<p>So, why insects? Regardless of its looks that most of people don’t fancy, insect as food is not only contain high nutrition (protein, vitamins and minerals) that can be found in fish and meat, but also way healthier as it contains less fat (as for the ratio). Harvesting insect is way easier than harvesting cows, pigs and sheep; they need less food to raise, emit fewer greenhouse gases, and by consuming insect we also help reduce pest insects without using any insecticides. Last but not least, farming insect can become a new form of business that can be done in the developing tropical countries (which usually suffered for poverty) where those insects mostly live.</p>

*The why insects paragraph above is actually one of the most important paragraphs in our report. It is already a good try but should still be improved, we should think about this!*

<p>Here are the brief explanations of the advantages of eating insects (Huls, et al., 2013)</p>
<p>1.	Environmental opportunities: the environmental benefits lie in the high feed conversion efficiency of insects. For example, crickets require only 2kg of feed for every 1 kg of body weight gain. Insect can be reared on organic side-streams (including human and animal waste) and can help reduce environmental contamination. It emits fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia, require significantly less land and water, and compared with mammals and birds, insect also pose less risk of transmitting zoonotic infections to humans, livestock and wildlife (although this topic needs further research).</p>
<p>2.	Nutrition for human consumption: insects are highly nutritious and healthy food source with high fat, protein, vitamin, fiber and mineral content. For example the composition of unsaturated omega-3 and six fatty acids in mealworms is comparable with that in fish, and the protein, vitamin and mineral content of mealworms is similar to that in fish and meat. </p>
<p>3.	Insect as animal feed: insect-based feed products could have a similar market to fishmeal and soy, which are presently the major components used in feed formulae for aquaculture and livestock. </p>

*Animal feed is indeed very important, because animal feed is such a huge part of our current agricultural use. This needs to be explicitely stated with a good reference to that.*
<p>4.	Processing: insects are often consumed as whole but can also be processed into granular or paste forms. Extracting proteins, fat, chitin, minerals and vitamins is also possible. At present such extraction processes are too costly and will need to be further developed to render them profitable and applicable for industrial use in the food and feed sectors. </p>

*processing is not an advantage, you should change the name of this paragraph to 'extracting of nutritional building blocks'*

<p>5.	Livelihood and economic improvement: insect gathering and rearing as minilivestock at the household level or industrial scale can offer important livelihood opportunities for people in both developing and developed countries. It also can offer employment and cash income, for example in developing countries in Southern and Central Africa and Southeast Asia, the process of insect gathering, rearing and processing is easily within reach of small-scale enterprises. </p>


<h4 id="-Mealworm-"><em>Mealworm</em></h4>

<p>There are thousands of insect’s species around the world and more than 1900 species have reportedly been used as food. Globally, the most common insects consumed are beetles (Coleoptera). This is not surprising given that the group contains about 40% of all known insect species. The insect family has a great number in terms of species. The figure below shows the number of insect species, by order, consumed worldwide (Huls, et al., 2013).</p>
<p> As can be seen in the graph above, the difference of the insect quantity consumed worldwide is quite big in the coleopteran order. This brings an interest for us to narrow our focus on coleopteran order, which is beetle. Another interesting fact occurs as we learn more about beetle; it turns out mealworm that is already quite famous as an exotic food, is a larval form of beetle.  There are quite numbers of information and articles about mealworm as food, which indicating that some people already acknowledge it as food; thus it brings positive advantage to our projects. Not only mealworm wins in quantity and fame, it is also contain high nutrition (dried): 46-53% protein, 28% fat, 6% fiber, 5% water, environmentally safe, simple production process (we believe so because it’s small and have no hard shell like beetle), and better yet- have a short life cycle. This is why we believe that mealworm will be a best candidate for a further study. </p>
