###Production cost barrier
  
  
  Farming of eatable mealworms is currently done by private farmers for their own use. Therefore the farming can not build a 
  certain scale to lower production costs. Major investments can not be done, development in machines can not be done nor a production systematic can be established.
  Competitive food for insects in common and Mealworms in specific are all other kind of food.
  They are often called Substitute products. Systematic food production is known for 1000 of years in the agricultural 
  Business. As well as the industrial production of meat began in the late 19th century and was a startin point for other Businesses.
  Right now now the farming of insects can not compete with those products in price as well as on a a qualitative level.
