###Production cost barrier


  Farming of edible mealworms is currently done by private farmers for their own use *Mostly in Asia, right? Elsewhere they prefer to harvest them from the wild if I remember well. It should be checked maybe -Marie*. Therefore the farming can not build *it's rather "reach", isn't it? -Marie* a
  certain scale to lower production costs. Major investments can not be done, development in machines can not be done *repetition of "done" => replace by "performed"? -Marie* nor a production systematic can be established.
  Competitive food for insects in common and Mealworms in specific are all other kind of food. *rather the ones providing proteins I think*
  They are often called Substitute products. Systematic food production is known for 1000 of years in the agricultural
  Business. As well as the industrial production of meat began in the late 19th century and was a starting point for other Businesses.
  Right now the farming of insects can not compete with those products in price as well as on a qualitative level.


  *I think your text is not yet very good because it lacks some flow and a plan about what you want to say - Matthias*

  *I try to propose a plan :*

  Begin with that the agricultural optimization and food processing technology has made huge leaps forwards since the industrial revolution. Talk for 3 sentences about this and add a source.
  *For the source I suggest Global Agricultural Performance:Past Trends and Future Prospects by Mette Wik, Prabhu Pingali, and Sumiter Broca. The document is on Teambition Bacchus/ducuments/Pingali-Global_Agricultural_Performance.pdf -Marie*

  Then state that the western disgust towards insects made that serious research about insects for food is never done and that they missed the boat of the agricultural industrialization.
  *There you can refer to my part on acceptance -Marie*

  Then you can write that most insects eaten around the world are currently being harvested or farmed in households but that in order to have a constant supply and the quality needed for todays markets that they will need to be produced on a large scale.
*For insects harvested in the wild, there is also the problem of pesticides and other heavy metals you can mention: we don't know where they went beofre being harvested -Marie*

  You can end with a positive note referring to some companies already working on industrializing it such as timy farms and the mcgill team *And maybe the Chinese industrial-scale production of mealworm factory for animal feed: HaoCheng Mealworm Inc.-Marie*. Also, that we can learn from related production processes such as bees and silkworms who are already farmed for a long time or insects produced for animal feed.*
