Top Players

This Company based in California could be considered the older player in this market as they have been selling processed insects for around 25 years. They produce “novelty” products using insects, ranging from candies to snacks.  They distribute insects embedded into popsicles or prepared to eat as a snack straight from the bag. Their mealworms are sold whole with flavoring such as BBQ, Cheddar cheese or Mexican spice.

Edible Unique is one of the companies based on UK that already have set up international shipping for their products. They have a wide range of products regarding insects. They sell whole insects dried and cooked ready to be eaten from the pack. Their products include no extra seasonings or preservatives being as natural as possible. In addition to their whole insect line, they also distribute grasshopper, pupae and mealworm flour.

Another British company that is already venturing on the insects market. Bush Grub distributes whole roasted mealworms with different flavors. They bet that their appealing flavors will convince the skeptic.  In addition they also produce mealworms based chocolate bars, being the only company that has started this kind of experiments on the market.

Green kow is a Belgian company using a very original strategy. They are producing spreads using a mix of usual products as tomato and chocolate with mealworms. Therefore it renders products with a recognizable taste for the customer while packing all the protein of the insects.  In addition, they are distributing their products in regular organic products store.

// I placed only four top players because they are the biggest distributing mealworm (for humans) right now. Please add any you have found!!
*Very good Iker ! I add 3 -2 from France and 1 from Spain (Micronutris should potentially be in the key players):*

In the South of France, a farm called Micronutris started in 2011 the production of crickets and mealworms for human consumption, which are available whole as a snack, but also processed in biscuits, appetizer biscuits, chocolate, and even macaroons! Their products are also used by a chef in a restaurant.

In Spain, Insagri produces crickets and grasshopers for human consumption (whole or in floor).
