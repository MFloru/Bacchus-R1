This Company based in California could be considered the older player in this market as they have been selling processed insects for around 25 years. They produce “novelty” products using insects, ranging from candies to snacks.  They distribute insects embedded into popsicles or prepared to eat as a snack straight from the bag. Their mealworms are sold whole with flavoring such as BBQ, Cheddar cheese or Mexican spice.
