**Mealworms and health issues**

* Nutritional values

Mealworms larvae are highly comparable to beef in terms of content (FAO, 2013) for a lesser environmental impact. Complete content studies of fresh mealworms have been carried out (Finke, 2002).

*Melinda, please insert here the nice graph you made for the PPT presentation!*

The table below presents more detailed results of the important results of these studies. We put the daily nutritional recommended values for comparison:

As a conclusion, the consumption of mealworms represents a good alternative to beef meat.

* Microbial safety

At the moment, it has been proven that a heating step is sufficient to get rid of Enterobacteriaceae and other. However, the presence of spore-forming bacteria remains a potential risk that cannot be completely solved by boiling. Further research has to be carried out including refrigerating, drying and acidifying (H.C. Klunder, 2012)

* Allergy

According to some studies, people frequently in contact with mealworms larvae risk to develop allergic reactions such as the inflammation of the eyes and nose (FAO, 2013)
