Currency and Exchange Rates Risk

Considering that the largest producers nowadays are concentrated in a handful of countries, given the case that this product becomes “mainstream “the exchange rates will be a problem hindering the expansion of the market to new  countries. Therefore, any company that intends to develop in this industry can take in account ways to face the exchange rates in nearby countries where the expansion is possible (Latin American countries as possible market for USA companies, EU and North Africa for UK companies)

There are countries as Mexico, where even though insects are part of the culture and widely eaten fried. The regulations about the processed food forbid the inclusion of more than 10% insect in any product. This is an example of a country where the products made with insect flour would be illegal and could trigger court problems.
