*Good but lacks of references maybe -I'll finish to review it later-luch time! -Marie*

###Supply chain

####Strategy
3D concurrent engineering : supply chain is a strategic weapon.
*What does "3D concurrent engineering" mean?! Maybe you should add a sentence of 2 to clarify it -Marie*
Therefore we need to investigate the following questions :

Vertical integration : where to position you *=> where sould you position yourself - Marie* in the supply chain from growing the insects to selling them to customers *to get the maximal revenue, is that the purpose? If so we should state it -Marie*?

Marketing : how to use the supply chain process as a strategic weapon in making customers buy your product?

Global supply chain : do we produce and sell globally or locally?

/*I have a doubt whether we are or not an actual company, if we are not then you have to adjust the titles, but if we are then its ok.
*I think we are not but we adress guys who plan to start companies in the edible insects industry*

Clockspeed : What is the clockspeed of the industry and how does this affect innovation in the industry?

####Vertical integration : positioning
What are the key competences? To know that, we first need to do a breakdown in the different parts of the vertical supply chain for food products based on mealworms :

Production of insects

Processing insects into a product

Selling and marketing to end consumer

#####Production (breeding or rearing) of insects
Big factories, advantages :

1 economies of scale

2 control of product safety and nutritional content and collection of all process data to make fast improvements
*free from pesticides insects \o/ - Marie*

3 in house development of production competencies and capabilities, development of optimal and automated production processes.


OR sourcing from small household farms could be possible if everything can be tracked (blockchain technology). In that case the quality can be assured. This is not our focus, however, we want to mention it. What is good about this is that big upfront investments are not needed and that it helps to grow a community who likes to eat insects. This reduces risk in 3 ways at the same time :

1 less financial risk : you con't have to invest in a factory

2 less demand risk : it creates a more loyal customer base.

3 more liquidity : costs are more variable as it is easy to stop buying from some people when the demand is low due to the fact contracts are small in quantity and duration.
*Yes but then it triggers survival problem of of these farms, doesn't it?* 
*I'd advocate a milk cooperative model, with insects farmed in different places and shipped to a same processing factory where there are economies of scale. Of course, this factory checks the farms respect the food safety standards in breeding insects. Then it requires an invested, but that can be shared by farm communities and better amortized-Marie*

Production is nowadays clearly a key competitive advantage because the knowledge of production is still in full development. However, once this is developed, production of the intermediary product of mealworm flour won't stay a competitive advantage. Mealworm flour will become a staple food that can only compete on price. However, then this can be changed by working on the nutritional content of the flour and producing different kinds of flour meeting the nutritional needs of different market segments.
*Also, flour producers can diversify themselved making processed products from their flour -Marie*

#####Processing into insect products
Here economies of scale are very important. Only a fully automated process that can process insects continuously is viable in the long term. Therefore, it will be best to be able to source insects from different breeding plants. If there is for example a pest breaking out in one plant, there can still be sourced from another plant.

A key competitive advantage will be inventing products that have a delicious taste and good appearance. These will be needed to grow the market from almost zero today to a serious alternative for traditional meat.

#####Selling and marketing to end customer

Very related to the end product, this last part can create an enormous value if it can make people believe in the *safety and taste of the -Marie* products. This will make the difference between being able to ask a relatively high price or having to compete with cheap products, for example frozen burgers.

It also includes the channels you choose to sell :

Supermarkets : have a high buyer power but most convenient way to buy food for Europeans and Americans so has to become a sales channel once the mealworm product market becomes big enough. Will require you to deliver high volumes with constant quality, not very suitable for a startup.

Specialized shops : shops specializing in bio- and organic food can be a good base to start selling the products. Typically, products sold there have a higher price, but you will have to prove that the food you sell is healthy/environmental friendly.

Online : Currently, this is the way most used to sell insects. However, as you will have to make use from external package delivery companies, this has some limitations. In China, delivery of food is normal, but in Europe and the USA not really. Fresh food is almost not possible. An alternative is to set up a delivery system yourself but that is too risky with unsure future sales of the insect based products.

Restaurants : Can be an easy way to distribute insects. Also, cooks who like to work with you will express their creativity and find new ways to cook with mealworm flour.

Festivals-party : Tapping in the event-sector with snacks you sell on festivals or parties is another way to reach the consumer. Moreover, it is a marketing tool where you get paid for. You only have to convince the organizators and can showcase your product to all participants of the party.

#####Key competitive advantages : recommendations

Short term : producing and processing and selling

Long term : processing and selling


**IDEA (explained in business model part, is there a need to add it somewhere here as well?) : work together with existing companies for petfood and start licensing them for your products while helping them develop the capabilities in terms of health and nutrition to grow insects for human consumption**





####Marketing & Supply chain as a strategic weapon


#####Transparency

The strategic weapon of the supply chain.
The highly educated, middle class, young urban population of the creative class in Europe or amerika is our target. They can spend a premium on food that is delicious, healthy and environmental friendly.
How to prove this? ==> Transparency

Attach a chip to each product package. The process parameters that you will show to the consumer of that specific package (accessable via a QR code) :

Start with a batch of insects, their breeding times, temperatures, nutritional input (food)...
Then transportation time and temperature of the environment while being transported to the factory to process them.
Then the parameters during processing.
Then time and transport to end consumer.

Also add information about the processes used (the conceptual idea so people get it but cannot ‘copy’ the machine)
Also add the places where it has been with gps(makes it more difficult to make fake products and proves that it is locally made).
Information about the exact nutritional content needs to be visualized.
Finally, add all resources used and make a sum of them to show that it is environmentally friendly.


This gives people the ability to fully understand what is inside their food. As we will only use natural ingredients they will be able to judge that these ingredients are healthy.
Also with this ID it becomes possible to warn people when something is wrong with their product and to trace those products back.
Also it can help us to give more accurate information on how long you can still keep it fresh.

#####Blockchain technology

How to make them believe us?
Technology can help us in this way.

**MAYBE : put a general description of blockchain in the tech part, and then we see that we have different uses for that.**

We can make some kind of blockchain issued by us but publicly known. Only we can issue it, so this makes it more difficult to make a fake product. When people check their product online, they will allways be able to check the full blockchain, so we can not falsify it.
Every product package has an id and chip with a blockchain attached to it. The blockchain works in a way that it will only execute the next step if the previous step is done, with a timestamp. This means we cannot cheat and put fake things inside.
Timestamps are also a way to control suppliers.

REMARK : actually I am still not sure how exactly blockhain can help us. Do you have some better ideas, do you get the idea I describe here?
*I agree that adjusting blockchain to our product is really forcing it, but we HAVE to. Maybe we can use blockchain as a way to ensure our transactions online?, payment as bitcoin, or some other applications. The blockchain id in every package was our original idea, I strongly think we have to stay by it*

Is this dangerous?
Off course, making it open encourages competition. However, in the beginning of a new industry, having lots of players in the market is good as this will help grow the market. Then, to survive, it is important to become the strongest company that can set the standard (refer to Stephen lu). This model that can be followed by others is good as standard and once they use this standard it will be easier for us to source our products there.
Also, an important advantage is that you can keep all information, big data. Your competitors can not acquire as much information as you.  With all this data, it will be possible, together with the short life cycle and fast clockspeed, to improve the process very fast and iteratively. This can lead to new opportunities in terms of nutritional content and waste, because nowadays much is done by convention and not yet backed by extensive research.


#####reach the consumer

As discussed before, online sales is the most popular medium nowadays. It seems to be that this is the general case for startups. Therefore, companies do not think a lot about how to sell their products and just assume the best way is using the internet.
However, it should not be forgotten that other channels can make the difference between becoming succesful or not. Having a stand selling your products on festivals, selling in specialized shops, selling in fitness centra or sportsclothing shops when you target sports people... Every company should think about alternative ways to sell in order to pick the best one.

In a later stage, once the product becomes succesful, supermarkets can be targeted.
*In some cases, products can be jump started by super markets, if we get some supermarket to push the initiative it could greatly improves the initial acceptance, therefore the association with super markets could be very important*


####Sourcing & Supply chain : global or local?
Competition from countries with cheaper labour can become an issue, as the highest cost of producing insects right now is manual work (according to mail with tiny farms+ other sources).
Also there are already bigger companies in those countries, e.g. haocheng mealworm inc.
A strategy could be to start sourcing from them once they become a threat.
However, 2 facts shield local production in Western countries from this threat : perishability and consumer acceptance.
/*Remember to point out that most of the cheap labor countries products could not be as high quality or the process could not eb as green

Acceptance :In this stage only if it is regarded as delicious, healthy, organic, environmental friendly, thrustable, grown in own country.
Therefore the transparency strategy and local production.

Perishability : part of the food to sell will be fresh food, putting an extra barrier to companies who produce abroad. For mealworm flour in itself this is not a barrier.

For fresh insect based products : very local production :
Possible to grow them in urban areas or near to urban areas in order to deal with transportation cost and time (maybe the mushroom farming as an example with link to the blue economy, waste!!)
.

Developing countries also not a target market : less creative class & will not pay a higher price for food. Therefore, not much advantages of a global supply chain. Keep it local!

####Clockspeed & Innovation
The life cycle of insects is very short, as mentioned in earlier parts
This makes the clockspeed of innovation in the growing process very high
Also goods are fast consumed, so consumers will very fast come back or not.
Look up more about clockspeed....

Innovation through the continuous collection of data about breeding process. Constantly working with slight variations can become the base for experiments that can lead to insects containing the optimal nutritional content made at the cheapest price.
Much of the breeding today is still done without a full understanding of the best parameters, this will change this to a fully known and optimized process.
**we should write more about this in the technology part**

###Business Model

Here we want to present the business model of the ideal insect for food company. It is a fictitious mind exercise, not pretending to give a waterproof strategy to win the market. However, it will help to give an understanding of all the concepts we touched throughout the report and show the direction that our research is indicating.

####Business model canvas
The business model canvas will visualize and summarize the ideas we have about organizing your complete supply chain.

I will make 1 canvas for an early stage startup company and one for a later stage company.

Do this first or afterwards? Or both?
Still to do.
/If you want to present both it will look very complete

####Growth strategy

Start a crowdfunding campaign to test the market and get money (I should find an article about the financial and customer binding implications of crowdfunding).

Then start with producing yourself to have a learning curve of what is possible with insects breeding. Only in a later stage you can specialize in only processing and sales. Record all information about your processes and make this information transparent.

Sell small quantities through specialized channels. Focus on products with a high price, niche market like snacks, partyfood, food for sportspeople, selling to restaurants…

After getting a higher learning curve you can probably improve nutritional content and rampup production.

However even better is to start working with producers of insects on a lower level and teach them your standards (benefits : economies of scale, avoid competition from pet food producers). You implement your standards in terms of transparency in your suppliers.

Start specializing in the processing with flour as raw material into a product and selling the final products.

Now change your sales channels to supermarkets etc.

Products best produced in this stage are burgers targeted as meat against beef burgers and not as meat susbsitute.
/*burgers? are we just limiting into burgers? i think we have to leave it broad to any kind of meat style meatballs, steaks, etc*

####PLC
Add something about the ipodia lecture : product life cycle, early stage, setting the standard and refer to that looking to high tech industries is justified here.


###Supply chain

####Strategy

After studying the outside forces affecting the business, which we in this report grouped as market, norms, technology and law, a company can start developing a strategy for a successful business.
However, this is not enough. A successful strategy will soon be followed by competitors. A company will get a competitive advantage when it can deliver the best products, at the fastest rate, the best quality and for the lowest cost.
Charles fine puts it clear in his clockspeed paper (Charles Fine). Supply chain is a strategic weapon. The model he proposes to think about and design a company is 3D concurrent engineering.
It is the overlap of 3 disciplines : product (design and architecture) process (technical capabilities and manufacturing system) and supply chain(architecture and the logisitcs and coordination system).

*Add the 3 rings of 3D concurrent engineering here*

Pradeep Fernandes adds a fourth dimension : Marketing. This is the connection between studying the outside forces and working on internal operations. And that is exactly where a company in a nascent market has to excel in. Therefore, in this section, we assess the dimensions of the extended "4D" concurrent engineering in the insect business.

*Add the 4 rings of 3D concurrent engineering + marketing here*

*These four questions could be slightly accentuated in the design.*

Vertical integration : where should a company position itself in the complete supply chain from growing the insects to selling them to customers?

Marketing : how to use the supply chain process as a strategic weapon in making customers buy mealworm products?

Global supply chain : should a company produce and sell globally or locally?

Clockspeed : What is the clockspeed of the industry and how does this affect innovation in the industry?



####Vertical integration : positioning

In the 1980ies, IBM, completely dominant in the computer industry, launched the personal computer. They chose to make it a modular system and outsourced parts such as the processor (Intel) and the operating system (Microsoft). This choice was made to increase the speed to market and simplify the task of setting up a supply chain.
They got it wrong. The modular PC they built became just a standard box, while 'Intel Inside' and 'Operated by Windows' became the reasons to choose a PC for most of the customers. In 2004, IBM had to sell its PC division to Lenovo(http://news.cnet.com/IBM-sells-PC-group-to-Lenovo/2100-1042_3-5482284.html).
This story, again by Charles Fine, reveals the strategic impact of make-buy decisions. It is not just about lowering costs. A company has to carefully choose and develop its core competencies. Only then, outsourcing decisions can be made. To help with choosing the right core competencies, we break the vertical supply chain for mealworm based foods down into 3 parts :

Production of insects

Processing insects into a product

Selling and marketing to end consumer

#####Production (breeding or rearing) of insects


Production is nowadays clearly a key competitive advantage because the knowledge of breeding insects is not yet fully developed. Doing production in house is the only way to collect all information about processes and to implement continuous improvement.
However, once production processes are developed and the insect market starts to take off, production with as goal the intermediary product of mealworm flour will endure fierce competition. This both from existing pet food insect companies who want to tap into an additional market or other previous startups who developed their production processes as well. Mealworm flour will become a staple food that competes on price. Once this stage of competition is reached, a company needs to make the choice between staying in production or focussing on processing. If they stay, or they will have to develop the lowest cost processes or they will have to diversify. Diversifying is possible by working on the nutritional content of the flour and producing different kinds of flour meeting the nutritional needs of different market segments.

So far, we assume that production will be done in large factories. Another possibility is distributed production of insects. In third world countries, a minilivestock of insects can improve the livelyhood of people as it provides an additional source of income and food(FAO report p.125). In the West, urban farming is growing popular. Due to space limits in developed cities, nowadays it only supplies 5% of the urban food consumption(Future Directions international http://www.futuredirections.org.au/publications/food-and-water-crises/1406-feeding-the-cities-is-urban-agriculture-the-future-of-food-security.html). Concentrating on species such as insects, who require less space than other animals can be a strategic decision for urban farmers.

To help with a choice between traditional big factories and distributed production, we provide a list of advantages and disadvantages.

Big factories :

+ Economies of scale.

+ Control of product safety and nutritional content and collection of all process data to make fast improvements is possible with modern technology.

+ In house development of production competencies and capabilities, development of optimal and automated production processes.

+ No complext supplier coordination system needed.

- Large investment, large financial risk.

Distributed production :

+ Less financial risk : you don't have to invest in a factory.

+ Less demand risk : it grows an insect community that probably becomes a loyal customer base.

+ More liquidity : costs are more variable as it is easy to stop buying from some people when the demand is low due to the contracts that are small in quantity and duration.

- High quality cost: tracking of production practices needed to ensure quality. With modern technology this should be possible.

- High coordination cost : logistics and subcontracts contracts require a substantial effort.

#####Processing into insect products
Here economies of scale are very important. Only a fully automated process that can process insects continuously is viable in the long term.
Therefore, sourcing insects from different breeding plants will involve lower risks. The cumulative capacity of different mealworm plants can be needed to suplly a continuous mealworm based food product. Pests breaking out in an insect population is another risk that can be minimized with multiple supply plants. If a pest is breaking out in one plant, there can still be sourced from another plant.

Again, extensive data collection in order to reach continuous improvement is a need for a successful company.

A key competitive advantage will be inventing products that have a delicious taste and good appearance. These will be needed to grow the market from almost zero today to a serious alternative for traditional meat.
In parallel, the processes to make these food products will have to be developed.

#####Selling and marketing to endconsumer

Very related to the end product, this last part can create an enormous value if it can make people believe in the products. This will make the difference between being able to ask a relatively high price or having to compete with cheap products, such as for example frozen burgers.
The next part will go in more detail about strategies to build a brand as insect producer. Here, we limit the discussion to the different possibilities in sales channels.

Supermarkets : have a high buyer power but it is the most convenient way to buy food for Europeans and Americans. Therefore, it has to become a sales channel once the mealworm product market becomes big enough. Will require to deliver high volumes with constant quality, not very suitable for a startup.

Specialized shops : shops specializing in bio- and organic food can be a good base to start selling the products. Typically, products sold there have a higher price, but they will ask to proof that the food sold is healthy/environmental friendly.

Online : Currently, this is the way most used to sell insects. However, a startup will very likely have to make use from external package delivery companies. This has some limitations. In China, delivery of food is normal, but in Europe and the USA not really. Fresh food, apart from ready meals, is almost not possible. An alternative is that a company sets up a delivery system by itself. That is risky with unsure future sales of the insect based products.

Restaurants : Can be an easy way to distribute insects. Also, cooks who like to work with an insect provider will express their creativity and find new ways to cook with mealworm flour.

festivals-party : Tapping in the event-sector with snacks by selling on festivals or parties is another way to reach the consumer. Moreover, it is a marketing tool you get paid for. A startup only has to convince the organizators and can showcase its product to all participants of the party.

#####key competitive advantages : recommendation

In the short term, with the lack of reliable producers of insects today, combined with the advantages of learning from process data, a complete vertical integration of the supply chain can be advantageous.

The following graph, provided by the US Department of Agriculture, gives an indication that this strategy is probably not the best in the long term.
There is a huge difference between what the farmer gets for the food he produces and the ultimate retail price the customer pays. That money goes partly to the food processors and distributors and partly to the marketing and sales channels or retailers. The more processed the food is, the bigger this difference.
For complext food products based on insect flour, a big difference can be expected. Therefore, most of the generated value lies in the more downstream activities.

*Add graph of the spread in price between farmer and retailer of bread and flour here, I have the pdf*
( US Department of Agriculture http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices/food-prices,-expenditures-costs.aspx)

Still, producing of the insects itself will stay an important part of the supply chain. An analogy can be drawn with burgers, in which the best working marketing tool for the past years is using locally grown fresh beef for the burgers. The same will be true for insects.
An insect producer can make it a strategy to grow them organically and make the processors and marketeers use his high quality insects as a sales strategy.
For the processors and marketeers, a strategy can be to work closely together with suppliers and license them for products while helping them to develop the right capabilities in terms of health and nutrition.
