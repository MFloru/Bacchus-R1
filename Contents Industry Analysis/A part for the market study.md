FOR THE “Market study” PART

According to a statistical study carried on 368 Westerners, the likelihood of adopting insects as a substitute for meat is 12.8% [95% CI: 6.1–19.4%] for males and 6.3% [95% CI: 2.8–9.9%] for females, though one out of five meat consumers claims to be ready to adopt insects.

As another result, customers who want to reduce their meat intake are 4.5 times more likely to adopt insects. The most likely early-adopters of insects as a meat substitute are young males interested in the environmental impact of their food choice, open to try novel food and with weak attitude towards meat. The likelihood that such a person adopts insects as a meat substitute is 75%. 

Last of all, familiarity with entomology multiplies by 2.6 this likelihood; which confirms that communication on these practices is important for the development of this market. (Verbeke, 2014)
