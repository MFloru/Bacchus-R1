**Health issues**

As they are cold-blooded and much different from humans than mammals, insects are less likely to share common infections with us. However, some cases of allergies have been reported. 

In any case, health issues regarding edible insects have not yet been completely investigated because this research topic remains quite new in the scentific world. Further scientific studies are indeed required to investigate the safety of insects for human consumption and their nutritional contents (ANSES, 2015). The safety of insects as food shall also be ensured by an adequate preservation methods and appropriate safety regulations that have not been formulated either (FAO, 2013).


*First say something about that health issues are not yet thoroughly enough investigated because research about insects for food is still a rather new area in the scientific world. =>OK, but I prefer to put it inside the paragraph rather that starting by it*

*Finally, I totally reviewed this part*

As they are cold-blooded and much different from humans than mammals, insects are less likely to share common infections with us. However, they are rich in moisture and nutrients like any meat and can therefore provide a favorable microbial environment (FAO, 2013).
Some studies investigated the health effects of the consumption of several edible insects species, including their microbial safety, allergies - some cases have been reported, and nutritional values. 
Regarding insects harvested in the wild, another huge source of concern for human consumption is their content in pesticides and heavy metals. Indeed, we do not know what they absorbed. The rearing of insects in a closed area would avoid such contamination risks. 
In any case, health issues regarding edible insects have not yet been completely investigated because this research topic remains quite new in the scientific world. Further scientific studies are indeed required to investigate the safety of insects for human consumption and their nutritional contents (ANSES, 2015). The safety of insects as food shall also be ensured by an adequate preservation methods and appropriate safety regulations that have not been formulated either. 
Indeed, there are only very artisanal preservation techniques at the moment and the edible insect supply chain has not adopted yet the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) system that will probably be crucial to its further development into a real food industry (FAO, 2013)
