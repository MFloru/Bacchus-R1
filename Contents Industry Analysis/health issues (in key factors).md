**Health issues**

As they are cold-blooded and much different from humans than mammals, insects are less likely to share common infections with us. However, some cases of allergies have been reported, and further studies are required to investigate the safety of insects for human consumption (ANSES, 2015). This shall also be ensured by an adequate preservation methods and appropriate safety regulations (FAO, 2013).


*First say something about that health issues are not yet thoroughly enough investigated because research about insects for food is still a rather new area in the scientific world.*
