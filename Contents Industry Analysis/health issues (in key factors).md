**Health issues**

As they are cold-blooded and much different from humans than mammals, insects are less likely to share common infections with us. However, some cases of allergies have been reported. 

In any case, health issues regarding edible insects have not yet been completely investigated because this research topic remains quite new in the scentific world. Further scientific studies are indeed required to investigate the safety of insects for human consumption and their nutritional contents (ANSES, 2015). The safety of insects as food shall also be ensured by an adequate preservation methods and appropriate safety regulations that have not been formulated either (FAO, 2013).


*First say something about that health issues are not yet thoroughly enough investigated because research about insects for food is still a rather new area in the scientific world. =>OK, but I prefer to put it inside the paragraph rather that starting by it*
