####Why insects?

For most of the readers of this report, insects are not seen as desirable. Insects as a food source are even more exotic.
However, they can be a tasty, healthy and environmental friendly novel food.
Discover with us how insects can provide our current world society with a new source of valuable nutrients.


####Key drivers

With all the advantages of insects, it is still not sure they will be able to establish themselves as a serious alternative for traditional meat.
Lots of issues will have to be addressed, especially to sell it in Western countries.
Here, we give a short overview of the key drivers that will decide whether insect food will become a real industry or will die as a temporary fashion.


####Mealworm flour

Insects as a group consist of thousands of different species.
Some are better suited to address the key drivers than others.
The way of processing and marketing them will also influence the success of insects.
Discover here why mealworm flour is probably a good bet to establish a serious insect industry with.

####Norms

Under the wide field of 'norms', we address all issues that affect the behaviour of people towards mealworm based food products.
Also, the desirability of accepting insects as food is investigated, especially with regards to the nutritional value and environmental impact.

####Law

In a modern society, laws regulate the boundaries of what is possible.
Most insect food producers today are working in a grey and almost lawless zone, what is seriously limiting the possibility to scale up.
We investigate the current situation and prospects for law about insect food in Western countries in this part.

####Technology

Agricultural technology has greatly improved since the industrial revolution, allowing us to feed our fast growing world population.
As insects are only considered as a food source in the West since a couple of years, they missed that productivity increase.
Innovative startups already pioneered practices to produce insects on an industrial scale.
Here, we look at current practices and suggest some improvements, drawn from solutions in similar industries.

####Market

Insect based food products can try to address many existing markets.
We quantify the size and price level of possible markets them in order to find opportunities.
Then, we assess the competitive landscape with help of Porter's forces.
You can also find an overview of current players in the insect and mealworm food business here.

####Supply chain

The previous parts gave a good knowledge of all forces affecting insect food producers.
A supply chain strategy decides about the long term profitability of those companies.
In this part, we take into account all the outside forces, or the revenue side of the profit equation, to answer decisions about the operational design of mealworm food companies, the cost side of that same equation.

#####Business model

The business models presented here can be seen as the capstone of this project.
They represent the direction all research done in this project is pointing towards.
Feel free to discover how an ideal mealworm food business looks like in our opinion!
