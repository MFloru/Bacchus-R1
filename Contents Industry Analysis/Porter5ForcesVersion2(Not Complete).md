Porter Five Forces

  Buyer Power



End Product Buyer
	    
•	The buyers can buy either bulk size or retail size

•	The primary channel for buyers is web stores

•	The buyers are less sensitive to high prices (gourmet/innovative food) 

•	Low customer loyalty

•	The product can be breed by customers



End Product Producer Company *it took me some time to understand what it meant, I suggest to simplify in "Producer of end product". Also, when in the following you refer to "product", it looks like it can mean "mealworms" or "end product" = flour or other transformed mealworms. So I would advise to specify which one you refer to*
      
•	The product can be breed by customers

•	Low customer loyalty

•	The product can be customized by their needs

•	Product can be bought online

•	Sensitive to high prices







  Supplier Power:
  
  
Producing our own insects *I think we shall not indentify ourselves as the customer, hence remove the "our" and replace it by "Self-producing customer"*
	    
•	No suppliers



Buying insects from farms *I'd put "Farm suppliers" because we are now analysing in their perspective*
      
•	Human consumption level suppliers are few (less than 50 worldwide)

•	The size of the suppliers is small to medium (less than 50 employees)

•	There are a couple similar products (buffalo worm, soldier fly larvae)

•	There are not set regulations for breeding in some countries






 Competitive Rivalry
 
•	Not many competitors

•	Innovative products

•	Small target market

•	The product offered is different (transparent processes) *still not very clear for me :/. Are we the company who will offer this different because more transparent product?*





Threat of Substitution

•	Vegan grade produced food is already positioned in market 

•	Vegan grade produced food has no negative social acceptance factor

•	Substitute products price tag is high 

•	Meat is cheaper and highly available

•	Vegetables are cheaper and highly available






Threat of New Entry

•	Pet consumption level producers are moderate-high (less than 200 worldwide)

•	Pet consumption level producers can adjust their processes and produce human consumption level products
•	The product difficulty is low, competitors can be set up overnight

•	There is no brand recognition yet

•	Processes are easily replicable

•	No patents held

Threat of New Entry: *I made minor changes in the way it was written*

The industry of mealworm products doesn’t involve the usage of very complex industrial tasks neither in breeding nor processing the insect. Therefore, it is likely that new companies can enter the market without requiring too large economic investment or time. Also as the processes are not hard to replicate, there is no patents held that can slow the competitors down. This is one risk/benefit of the industry.  If more players start producing, it will attract the attention of powerful investors and could help boosting the industry for the benefit of all the involved. Also, it can put at risk the small distributors if larger multinationals start developing economies of scale and provide lower prices. 
	Another threat is that there is nowadays a considerable (less than 200 worldwide*) number of companies that process and breed mealworms for animal consumption. This companies have already a very structured and organized process. If they were to decide and adjust their methods to produce human-grade mealworm products, then that could make the market more competitive. 
	The last threat would be the lack of brand awareness by the public. As the product is not highly widespread, the public would highly agree to change brand as there is no high brand recognition. A strong merchandising should be made in order to avoid this. 

*Based on: 58 different suppliers in Alibaba, at least 50 more suppliers obtained from a google search
*The numbers does not really correspond. Maybe we'd better try to make a research with the SIC number. Also, it seems odd to me to say "considerable number" along with "less than"*

Threat of Substitution:

As everyone has to eat, the market for products that satisfy this basic need is swamped with different alternatives. This get narrowed down when closing in to products that doesn’t include animal meat yet can provide the nutrients to survive. Our product (insect based flour) will face primarily the vegan-grade foods. This products are made with vegetables, mushrooms, algae and roots. They use chemicals and sauces to imitate the flavor of common foods like beef or pork.  This products have lots of nutrients that the real meat does not, but lack very important others (protein, fat). 
Even though vegan-grade products doesn’t provide proteins, there have been in the market for more than 5 years.  Those products are already embedded in the minds of the target market and are highly available in specialized supermarkets and vegan stores.  Furthermore, the vegan-grade products does not generate the “disgusting factor” on the buyer, thus making them even a mightier substitute that will be hard to overcome.  On the bright side, the vegan-grade products are pricy, so customers could decide to buy our product instead if the price difference is attractive enough. 
	One of the big problems of entering the food market is that it is highly controlled by the meat products. Even our target market is specifically people that prefer not to eat meat while keeping healthy levels of protein in their bodies. Therefore if our product doesn’t meet the level of satisfaction that the clients expect, they will probably prefer to go back to eat meat in small quantities rather than continue consuming our products.  Meat is highly available in any super market or restaurant, and the prices although sometimes high could overcome the trouble of dealing with flours made second-rate products. 
	The vegetables, on the other hand, also provide a very important substitute for our products. Our target market if unsatisfied by our product can decide to get their proteins intake from vegetables and plants.  Although the amount of vegetables and plants required to satisfy the human protein needs is high, the end user could prefer to do that instead of our product. 

*I heard that vegan products had vegetal protein... ? Could you check it out?*
