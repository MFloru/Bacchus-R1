Porter Five Forces

  Buyer Power



End Product Buyer
	    
•	The buyers can buy either bulk size or retail size

•	The primary channel for buyers is web stores

•	The buyers are less sensitive to high prices (gourmet/innovative food) 

•	Low customer loyalty

•	The mealworms can be breed by customers (but not processed)



Producer of end product *it took me some time to understand what it meant, I suggest to simplify in "Producer of end product". Also, when in the following you refer to "product", it looks like it can mean "mealworms" or "end product" = flour or other transformed mealworms. So I would advise to specify which one you refer to*
      
•	The mealworms can be breed by customers

•	Low customer loyalty

•	The mealworms can be customized by their needs

•	Mealworms can be bought online

•	Sensitive to high prices







  Supplier Power:
  
  
Self producing customer*I think we shall not indentify ourselves as the customer, hence remove the "our" and replace it by "Self-producing customer"*
	    
•	No suppliers



Farm suppliers *I'd put "Farm suppliers" because we are now analysing in their perspective*
      
•	Human consumption level suppliers are few (less than 50 worldwide)

•	The size of the suppliers is small to medium (less than 50 employees)

•	There are a couple similar products (buffalo worm, soldier fly larvae)

•	There are not set regulations for breeding in some countries






 Competitive Rivalry
 
•	Not many competitors

•	Innovative products

•	Small target market

•	The product offered is different (transparent processes) *still not very clear for me :/. Are we the company who will offer this different because more transparent product?* / ** not sure how we are going to tacke this idea, but i prefer to write it rather than not ** 





Threat of Substitution

•	Vegan grade produced food is already positioned in market 

•	Vegan grade produced food has no negative social acceptance factor

•	Substitute products price tag is high 

•	Meat is cheaper and highly available

•	Vegetables are cheaper and highly available






Threat of New Entry

•	Pet consumption level producers are moderate-high (less than 200 worldwide)

•	Pet consumption level producers can adjust their processes and produce human consumption level products
•	The product difficulty is low, competitors can be set up overnight

•	There is no brand recognition yet

•	Processes are easily replicable

•	No patents held

Threat of New Entry: *I made minor changes in the way it was written*

The industry of mealworm products doesn’t involve the usage of very complex industrial tasks neither in breeding nor processing the insect. Therefore, it is likely that new companies can enter the market without requiring too large economic investment or time. Also as the processes are not hard to replicate, there is no patents held that can slow the competitors down. This is one risk/benefit of the industry.  If more players start producing, it will attract the attention of powerful investors and could help boosting the industry for the benefit of all the involved. Also, it can put at risk the small distributors if larger multinationals start developing economies of scale and provide lower prices. 
	Another threat is that there is nowadays a considerable number of companies* that process and breed mealworms for animal consumption. This companies have already a very structured and organized process. If they were to decide and adjust their methods to produce human-grade mealworm products, then that could make the market more competitive. 
	The last threat would be the lack of brand awareness by the public. As the product is not highly widespread, the public would highly agree to change brand as there is no high brand recognition. A strong merchandising should be made in order to avoid this. 

*Based on: 58 different suppliers in Alibaba, at least 50 more suppliers obtained from a google search
*The numbers does not really correspond. Maybe we'd better try to make a research with the SIC number. Also, it seems odd to me to say "considerable number" along with "less than"* ** I changed that, no longer saying any number on the paragraph, and rather we will add it in the footnote. *

Threat of Substitution:

As everyone has to eat, the market for products that satisfy this basic need is swamped with different alternatives. This get narrowed down when closing in to products that doesn’t include animal meat yet can provide the nutrients to survive. Our product (insect based flour) will face primarily the vegan-grade foods. This products are made with vegetables, mushrooms, algae and roots. They use chemicals and sauces to imitate the flavor of common foods like beef or pork.  This products have lots of nutrients that the real meat does not, but lack very important others (high content ofprotein, fat). 
Even though vegan-grade products doesn’t provide high protein levels, there have been in the market for more than 5 years.  Those products are already embedded in the minds of the target market and are highly available in specialized supermarkets and vegan stores.  Furthermore, the vegan-grade products does not generate the “disgusting factor” on the buyer, thus making them even a mightier substitute that will be hard to overcome.  On the bright side, the vegan-grade products are pricy, so customers could decide to buy our product instead if the price difference is attractive enough. 
	One of the big problems of entering the food market is that it is highly controlled by the meat products. Even our target market is specifically people that prefer not to eat meat while keeping healthy levels of protein in their bodies. Therefore if our product doesn’t meet the level of satisfaction that the clients expect, they will probably prefer to go back to eat meat in small quantities rather than continue consuming our products.  Meat is highly available in any super market or restaurant, and the prices although sometimes high could overcome the trouble of dealing with flours made second-rate products. 
	The vegetables, on the other hand, also provide a very important substitute for our products. Our target market if unsatisfied by our product can decide to get their proteins intake from vegetables and plants.  Although the amount of vegetables and plants required to satisfy the human protein needs is high, the end user could prefer to do that instead of our product. 

*I heard that vegan products had vegetal protein... ? Could you check it out?* **Indeed they have, the sentences are corrected.  **

Supplier Power:
	Self-producing customer
	The company that decides to breed insects for human consumption have no major supplier. The common suppliers of required services such as electricity, water, gas, etc. are not considered as suppliers therefore we can say that this type of company would not work with any supplier. 
Farm suppliers
Because consuming insects is still a considered as novelty food in the Western countries the legal framework to handle with this topic is still new and needs to be improved with time and experiences. That gives a good edge to companies that decide to focus on the breeding of the insects. The companies can exploit the lack of regulations in some countries at least for the foreseeable future. Its important to note that even in countries that historically have the habit of eating insects, there are no legal framework to deal with the industrial processing of them, leaving that as uncertainty for now. 
Another edge for the breeders is that currently there are less than 50 companies worldwide doing the same. This means the competitors are few and scattered all around the globe. Each of them have enough market to cover without the need of hard competition, for now. Also, this companies are in their majority startups. As this is novelty in Western countries, the startup companies mainly composed by young enthusiast. Because of this they can develop their ideas without the fear of a huge corporation entering the market. 
	In addition, the producers have a couple products with very similar characteristics. Although we are mainly talking about mealworm products, the larvae of the soldier fly and the buffalo worm (another kind of larvae) share lots of characteristics with the mealworms. Therefore, this also gives an edge to the producers that can shift between them based on the requirements of the market or the amount of competitors in each of those.
