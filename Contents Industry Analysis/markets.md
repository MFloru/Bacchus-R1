###Markets to seize ;)

The current market for insects in the West is very small. The customers mainly consist of early adopters, foodies, people who like to try new or exotic things and alike. Also, it starts to become popular at a party snack. Because the market is that new, analyzing the current customers and markets says very little about the future market insects as food can seize. We believe, to get an idea of the possible impact of insects as food, we should look at current similar markets where insects, and more in particular insect flour, can be a substitute. For these markets, we want to get an idea of the economic, ecologic and health impact insects can have. We identified the following markets insects can possibly substitute:

for humans :

Meat substitutes

Sports supplements

Burgers

Sausages

Snacks

Meat in general

for animals :

Chicken feed

Fish feed

Pet food

####For human consumption
#####Meat Substitutes

Meat substitutes in the West are products that are related to meat in terms of taste and nutritional value, but with plant based proteins as the main ingredient. Sustainability and health concerns are the main reasons to eat these products. Therefore, while the market was originally mainly intended for vegetarians, now the average health conscious urban citizen becomes the target. With the apparent health and ecological impact insects can have, it is very plausible that insects will be a viable alternative for the meat substitutes market.

In 2013, this market had an estimated size of 3.2 billion $ worldwide. Today, 80 % of the market is soy based(MarketsAndMarkets Analysis). The main products are tofu, tempeh, seitan and quorn. Lots of small players compete in this market. The 5 biggest players are : Quorn Foods Ltd. (U.K.), Blue Chip Group (U.S.), Vbites Foods (U.K.), Amy's Kitchen Inc. (U.S.), and Cauldron Foods (U.K.) (PR Newswire). Market Analysts believe the market will grow with a CAGR of 4.4 to 6.4% up to 6.4 billion $ in 2019 (MarketsAndMarkets Analysis & RTS Resource). However, Western market analysts completely underestimate the size of the Chinese market, where tofu is a mainstream part of the diet. The tofu market alone was worth 11 billion $ in 2014 in China and has been growing with a CAGR of 20% a year during the last 5 years. This growth is not expected to slow down as domestic demand is still increasing (IBISWorld).

In the USA, tofu sells for about 4 $/kg . Vegie sausages sell for 12 $/kg and vegie burgers sell for about 6 $/kg (Indiana Soybean Board).

#####Sports supplements

Sports supplements is quite a big market encompassing all bars, powders, drinks and alike that people eat or drink in addition to their normal diet to help their sport performance. Historically, the main customers of this market were young male adults wanting to grow their muscles faster after power workouts. However, more and more this market is becoming diversified and targets now all kinds of people who are doing sports to improve their health. Important in these products is that they contain exact amounts of  the additional nutrition people want. This means a simple insect powder would probably not be able to become a resource for this market. But, if it is possible to extract the proteins and omega 3 and 6 fatty acids insects are rich of, they could become a resource for this industry.

Studying what analysts think about the size of this market gives some useful insights. In 2007, BCC Research forecasted that the total market size would be 91.8 billion $ in 2013(BCC Research). In 2011, GIA estimated that the market would reach 67,1 billion $ in 2017 while in a recent report they forecast a size of 61 billion $ in 2020(Global Industry Analysts). It is clear that analysts tend to believe this market will grow way faster than it actually does. Also, almost 95% of this market is sports drinks, a category insect powder probably can't be an input for.

####For animal consumption
Insects as a resource for animal consumption is a more mature market than insects for human consumption. The main markets are pet food, chicken feed and fish feed. Still, an exploration of this market is useful to estimate the gap between the current state and the potential of insects for animal consumption. Also, looking at industrial practices of companies producing insects for animal consumption can reveal valuable information for the production process for human consumption.  And you are better aware of these companies, as they can become future competitors!

#####Pet food

The developed world accounts for more than 70% of the pet food market, for 90% existing of dog- and catfood(PMMI). However, with insects in mind, we should not forget about more exotic pets, who already eat large quantities of insects for their diets nowadays. It is a slowly growing market with a worldwide market size between 60 and 70 billion $ (GIA, Transparancy market research, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, PMMI).
The market is mainly dominated by a couple of big players : Mars, Nestl√©, Colgate-Palmolive, Procter&Gamble, Del Monte Foods(Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada).

An important market trend in the pet food market is the humanization of pets. Lots of people regard their pets almost as human beings, part of their family. This reflects in the market, where the same trends as in the human food market are seen : a trend towards healthy, organic and sustainable food. Also, in the USA, most customers expect that their pet food is made in the USA and not outsourced to production facilities in developing countries. These trends have both positive and negative implications for an companies who want to start producing insects for food on industrial scale. The trend towards healthy and ecological food can affect insects positively, if proper marketed. The trend towards local production can shield them from low cost competition. This competition can be severe, for example, in China, the company HaoCheng Mealworm Inc. is already processing insects on a vast industrial scale. On the other hand, the humanification of pets also raises questions about the acceptance of people to feed their pets insects(petfoodindustry). Will people who don't want to eat insects themselves feed their pets insects?
