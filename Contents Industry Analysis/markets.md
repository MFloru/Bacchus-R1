###Markets to seize ;)

The current market for insects in the West is very small. The customers mainly consist of early adopters, foodies, people who like to try new or exotic things and alike. Also, it starts to become popular at a party snack. Because the market is that new, analyzing the current customers and markets says very little about the future market insects as food can seize. We believe, to get an idea of the possible impact of insects as food, we should look at current similar markets where insects, and more in particular insect flour, can be a substitute. For these markets, we want to get an idea of the economic, ecologic and health impact insects can have. We identified the following markets insects can possibly substitute:

for humans :

Meat substitutes

Sports supplements

Burgers

Sausages

Snacks

Meat in general

for animals :

Animal feed

Pet food

####For human consumption
#####Meat Substitutes

Meat substitutes in the West are products that are related to meat in terms of taste and nutritional value, but with plant based proteins as the main ingredient. Sustainability and health concerns are the main reasons to eat these products. Therefore, while the market was originally mainly intended for vegetarians, now the average health conscious urban citizen becomes the target. With the apparent health and ecological impact insects can have, it is very plausible that insects will be a viable alternative for the meat substitutes market.

In 2013, this market had an estimated size of 3.2 billion $ worldwide. Today, 80 % of the market is soy based(MarketsAndMarkets Analysis). The main products are tofu, tempeh, seitan and quorn. Lots of small players compete in this market. The 5 biggest players are : Quorn Foods Ltd. (U.K.), Blue Chip Group (U.S.), Vbites Foods (U.K.), Amy's Kitchen Inc. (U.S.), and Cauldron Foods (U.K.) (PR Newswire). Market Analysts believe the market will grow with a CAGR of 4.4 to 6.4% up to 6.4 billion $ in 2019 (MarketsAndMarkets Analysis & RTS Resource). However, Western market analysts completely underestimate the size of the Chinese market, where tofu is a mainstream part of the diet. The tofu market alone was worth 11 billion $ in 2014 in China and has been growing with a CAGR of 20% a year during the last 5 years. This growth is not expected to slow down as domestic demand is still increasing (IBISWorld).

In the USA, tofu sells for about 4 $/kg . Vegie sausages sell for 12 $/kg and vegie burgers sell for about 6 $/kg (Indiana Soybean Board).

#####processed meat
Although meatproducts made from mealworm flour can theoretically replace any meat, their most direct concurrents are processed meats. A product based on mealworm flour can substitute a processed meat product, while there is still a difference between a steak and a mealwormburger. A short overview of the size of the processed meat industries is given here.
#####sausages
Business Analytic Center calculated the total European sausage production totalling 5,3 million ton at a market size of 19,5 billion euro(BAC). It's a highly fragmentated market with individual tastes that differ seriously among countries.
The US market of sausages and other processed meat products totalled 20,4 billion $ in 2009(Dun & Bradstreet).

ResearchMoz gives the current issues impacting this market : health, product quality, freshness and the search of new flavors and ethnic compatible products(ResearchMoz). A transparant production process of mealworm flour as main ingredient in a sausage can adress most of these issues.

#####ground beef : burgers and meatballs

The global market for beef is expected to reach USD 2,151 billion by 2020(GrandViewResearch). In 2012, 67400 kilo tons of beef was produced. Of that, 43,9% or 29500 kilo ton was sold as ground beef.
The retail price of a burger in the USA is historically high due to the lowest cattle herd in 60 years and not helped by environmental problems such as the drought in Texas(MarketWatch). The retail price of a kilo of ground beef in american supermarkets reached 9,15 $(AGWeb).

Cheaper burgers, containing more fat and other health affecting ingredients are still widespread. This is one of the main reasons that poor people in developed countries have a higher chance to be fat. However, the general public can react severely when they discover that inferior ingredients are used in their burgers, as the recent horsemeat scandal showed(the guardian). An in depth article about cheap burgers can be found at : http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/24/cost-cheap-burger-higher-12p

A burger made of mealworm flour with transparent ingredients, nutritional content and production process can be competitive on this market. It will first attract part of the people who eat high quality burgers. If economies of scale grow and price goes down, it can even play a big role on the cheap burger market as it will be a way more healthy alternative for such cheap burgers.




#####Sports supplements

Sports supplements is quite a big market encompassing all bars, powders, drinks and alike that people eat or drink in addition to their normal diet to help their sport performance. Historically, the main customers of this market were young male adults wanting to grow their muscles faster after power workouts. However, more and more this market is becoming diversified and targets now all kinds of people who are doing sports to improve their health. Important in these products is that they contain exact amounts of  the additional nutrition people want. This means a simple insect powder would probably not be able to become a resource for this market. But, if it is possible to extract the proteins and omega 3 and 6 fatty acids insects are rich of, they could become a resource for this industry.

Studying what analysts think about the size of this market gives some useful insights. In 2007, BCC Research forecasted that the total market size would be 91.8 billion $ in 2013(BCC Research). In 2011, GIA estimated that the market would reach 67,1 billion $ in 2017 while in a recent report they forecast a size of 61 billion $ in 2020(Global Industry Analysts). It is clear that analysts tend to believe this market will grow way faster than it actually does. Also, almost 95% of this market is sports drinks, a category insect powder probably can't be an input for.

####For animal consumption
Makkar et al. state that a 60–70% increase in consumption of animal products is expected by 2050(FAO). IFIF believes in an even more spectacular growth : meat consumption doubled by 2050 and fish consumption tripled(IFIF). The resources needed to supply all those animals with feed will be enormous.  In this Industry Analysis report, we focus on producing mealworm flour for human consumption. If more mealworms are eaten, this will substitute part of the traditional meat eaten. But we have to acknowledge that people will not completely change their diet from big animals to insects without any disasters obliging them to do so. Therefore, it is important to assess the size of the market of the feed of the animals we eat and check whether those markets can be penetrated by insects as well.  Moreover, with such growth perspectives of an already huge market, completely neglecting animal feed cannot be justified in economic and ecological sense.

Another possible market for mealworm flour is the use in petfood. That will be breefly covered as well.
#####Animal feed

The current total global market of animal feed has a size of 370-500 billion $ per year (IFIF,Alltech). This results in almost 1 billion ton of feed per year. The main categories of animal feed are feed for poultry(444 million ton), pig(243 million ton),ruminant animals(including cow and sheep)(196 million ton), fish feed(40 million ton) and pet food(21 million ton) (alltech). The lower amount of feed for ruminant animals is due to the fact that they are still today mostly fed on pasture from grasslands.

Most animals grown for human consumption ned a proteine rich diet to grow. Therefore, corn and soy as proteine rich grains, are the most popular animal feed. In addition, animals need sometimes animal protein to supply them with necessary amino acids. Fish meal is the most popular animal protein feed.The overreliance on grain-based animal feeds in industrial food animal production has negative consequences for animal health, the environment, and even human health(sustainable table). Grains for animal feed use 40% of total land use in agriculture(Kathryn Redford).

A good start to learn something about insects for feed is the Kathryn Redford TedX talk 'what to feed our food' (TedX).

Makkar et al. give the state of the art of insects used as animal feed. 5 species of insects are promising as their nutritional quality is rougly comparable with current soy and fishmeal : black soldier fly larvae, the house fly maggots,
mealworm, locusts–grasshoppers–crickets, and silkworm. The insects themselves can be fed by biological waste. In that case, they help towards a world with less waste while at the same time depleting less natural resources as traditional feed. Off course, a process that can ensure that the waste is not contaminated needs to be developed for such applications. Nowadays, European law does not allow to feed animals on waste. These regulations are a relict of the 1990s BSE crisis(BBC). 25-100% of traditional animal feed can be replaced by insects, depending on the insect and animal species. As supply of insects is nowadays still very small, poultry and fish feed will be the easiest to start supplying insect feed to. Other animals require a large supply of feed before they can switch to a new feed source.
Data of mealworms used in animal feed is not yet widespread. It could replace feed for chickens if supplemented with methionine. If only 10% of chicken feed is replaced by mealworms, no supplementary products are needed. A case for catfisch is investigated with the result that 40% of the feed can be replaced by mealworms(Makkar et al.).

Price levels to compete on were about 500$ per ton of chicken or pig feed in 2013(Alltech). However, especially in the poultry industry, fishmeal is nowadays a very important part of the diet for chickens. 20% of all fish caught worldwide is used in fishmeal. Due to the deterioration of the marine environment, the price of fishmeal is increasing. In 2010, that price was 2000$ per ton, a much more comfortable price to compete on for insects(Sánchez-Muros et al.).

The industry of insects for animal feed is still small but already more advanced than the industry of insects for human consumption. Some companies are already for years in the business and produce insects on industrial scale. Haocheng Mealworm Inc. is the biggest mealworm producer known and produces 50 tons of mealworms per month of which 200 tons per year are exported(http://www.hcmealworm.com/). Other companies producing different kinds of insects for animal feed are  : AgriProtein(South Africa), Enterra Feed Corporation (Canada), Envirflight(USA), Ynsect(France), Protix Biosystems(The Netherlands). (BBC)


#####Pet food

The developed world accounts for more than 70% of the pet food market, for 90% existing of dog- and catfood(PMMI). However, with insects in mind, we should not forget about more exotic pets, who already eat large quantities of insects for their diets nowadays. It is a slowly growing market with a worldwide market size between 60 and 70 billion $ (GIA, Transparancy market research, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, PMMI).
The market is mainly dominated by a couple of big players : Mars, Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive, Procter&Gamble, Del Monte Foods(Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada).

An important market trend in the pet food market is the humanization of pets. Lots of people regard their pets almost as human beings, part of their family. This reflects in the market, where the same trends as in the human food market are seen : a trend towards healthy, organic and sustainable food. Also, in the USA, most customers expect that their pet food is made in the USA and not outsourced to production facilities in developing countries. These trends have both positive and negative implications for an companies who want to start producing insects for food on industrial scale. The trend towards healthy and ecological food can affect insects positively, if proper marketed. The trend towards local production can shield them from low cost competition. This competition can be severe, for example, in China, the company HaoCheng Mealworm Inc. is already processing insects on a vast industrial scale. On the other hand, the humanification of pets also raises questions about the acceptance of people to feed their pets insects(petfoodindustry). Will people who don't want to eat insects themselves feed their pets insects?
