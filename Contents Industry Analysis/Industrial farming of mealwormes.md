###state of the art

The farming of mealworms today is not undiscovered but split up into an industrial use to 
sell them mainly as pet food e.g. chicken. The other farming method is for home farming, 
also mainly for pet food. The industrial farming methods are kept as a company 
secret. The fact that there is no known supply chain
or machines for the industrial use, makes is very likely that the professional farmes use
also the home methods. While there is few knowledge about the commercial farming, there
are many tutorials online how to farm mealworms at home.
Mealworm is a stage in the life cycle. Starting with an egg, the egg evolves to an Larve 
which is the mealworm itself. Then the larve turnes into a Pupa. Out of the pupa a beetle 
hatches.

###improvements through industrialization	
	
	+farming in many small boxes
	+normal distribution of lifecycle
	+cut of the eggs and the puba as well as the beetle
	+
	
###possible tools to be used

	+gloves and hygene articles
	+humidity and tempreture semsor
	+shaking grids to with different seize to cut off the "bycatch"
