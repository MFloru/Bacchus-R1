###state of the art

The farming of mealworms today is not undiscovered but split up into an industrial use to 
sell them mainly as pet food e.g. chicken. The other farming method is for home farming, 
also mainly for pet food. The industrial farming methods are kept as a company 
secret. The fact that there is no known supply chain
or machines for the industrial use, makes is very likely that the professional farmes use
also the home methods. While there is few knowledge about the commercial farming, there
are many tutorials online how to farm mealworms at home.
Mealworm is a stage in the life cycle. Starting with an egg, the egg evolves to an Larve 
which is the mealworm itself. Then the larve turnes into a Pupa. Out of the pupa a beetle 
hatches.

The home farming is usually done in a small transparent plastic box. The first step is to 
clean the box. This step includes emptying and disinfection of the box in order to kill 
any pests and sterilize. The sterilization process is done by home application in a oven. 
Next is to put a bedding into the the box. The bedding usually consists of chicken feed 
and oats. After this the mealworm eggs are placed into the box and some food scraps are 
added. Home farmes usually use carrots, potatoes, celery, squash, and watermelon rinds.
Primary reason for the food scraps is providing food, but a side effect is the higher 
humidity in the box necessary for the mealworms.
After the time to grow the mealworms they are ready to be harvested. The process of 
harvesting is done manually. The farmers picks the grown mealworms out of the box and 
separates them from the bedding and scraps. This step is the most work intenst part of
harvesting mealworms. 	
	
###improvements through industrialization	

exemplary improvements for system(plant), process, quality management and digitalization

Our goals for the farming process of providing constant superior quality of 
mealworms while lowering the price. To improve the process of farming mealworms we 
continue the process done by private farmes.
The major enhancement is done by analying the process steps and then improve it.

The cycle of mealworms growing from an egg to a to a beetle is statistically determined.
The larves will not not transform from eggs on a certain time and the pupa from the larve 
etc. So by farming many eggs some will transform earlier and some later.The optimal time 
for harvesting them is the 7. or 8. week since the initial farming processstep. Assuming a 
normal distribution for that process the percentage of bycatch like eggs, pupas and beetles
is shown in graph XX. 

 To reach our goal of superior quality the bycatch, the bedding and the scratch must be 
 separated from the product. Home farmer do this process step manually. This step is very 
 labor-intenst which leads to high costs due to loans even in low cost countries. Secondly
 the frequency of repeating the same process step is very high. So the manual work is 
 potentially automatable. A certain quantity of mealworms produced per time justifies the 
 initiale cost of a purpose-built machine to separate. Techniques for that machines can 
 be found in the high developed Business described above. There is a high variety of 
 machines for applications like separating harvest goods from waste.
 Agricultural machines use the different size of the waste and the product to separate 
 them.  One application is done by a grid with a different width. Harvested goods were run 
 over a grid like a conveyor band. The gap between two bars is getting bigger. So in the 
 first section small parts fall down between two grids. Then the mealworms are bigger and 
 fall in the next section. The rest that falls of at the end of the machine is also waste.
 The two exemplary videos show the process for onions.
 
 Due to fact that the harvest of mealworms is a not totally controllable process the risk 
 of failed harvest must be reduced. One way to do this is to farm in many "fields" separately.
 So the boxes can be kept. They provide a good tradeoff between a economic amount and 
fail safe production.
  To make the factory more economic the density in the room available has to be increased.
  This can be realized in multiple layers and rows. While the third dimension must be left
  accessable for the staff. The picture shows a propose for such a layout.

Further improvements of the farming process is a more scientific approach to check the 
variables of the farming process. The humidity and temperature are crucial variables that 
have to be controlled and regulated over the hole process. Instead of the food scrats to
provide the necessary humidity a digital sensor in a control loop with a humidifier is 
more accurate. Such a system sets up the possibility to evaluate and have early warning 
for a process out of control.

Hygiene standards in the classic food industries have to be adapted. The legislativ 
requirements in western countries for the farming of food will force the farming companies
to set up specific hygiene standards. But moreover the farmers themselve have a interest
in food safety. 
	
###conclusion

The proposed technique have a strong relationship to ones used in the agricultural and 
food producing business. Some of the techniques transferable while other have to be new
designed. So even though mealworms are a competitive product they profit from the development 
done.
