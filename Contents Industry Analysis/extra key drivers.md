**Environmental impact**

It is known that livestock rearing causes many environmental problems. According to studies, livestock production accounts for 70 percent of all agricultural land use and its rearing is responsible for 18 percent of GHG emissions (CO2 equivalent) –more than the transport sector (FAO, 2006). It also consumes 70% of freshwater worldwide (Pimentel, et al., 2004). With world’s growing population, it is time to find a more environmental-friendly source of protein.

**Nutritional value** 

If and only if insect can compete with traditional livestock regarding their nutritional values will they be able to pretend to replace them. Therefore, edible’s insect protein, fat, minerals and vitamin content shall be studied and compared to the ones of animals such as beef. Studies conducted on mealworms tend to prove so far (Finke, 2002; Siemianowska, 2013).
