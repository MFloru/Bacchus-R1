Laws and regulations in the United States for edible insects. 

The industry of the breeding and processing insects for human consumption is growing every day. Pitifully, it is facing big problems in the United States because of the lack of clear regulations on the matter. Right now, there is no state in the Union that clearly have specific regulations towards insect breeding or production for human consumption.  It seems that the laws and institutions were not ready for this industry to spur out.
	It is true that the breeding of insects for animal consumption has been widespread throughout USA and there are regulations regarding this as in any other pet food or feed. (Regulations such as the level of waste, pesticide, rat droppings, etc.). Sadly all this regulations are not fit for a human – grade farm. Due to this, the entrepreneur companies that have started in the edible insects market cannot set their process to any regulations. This can bring problems and uncertainty to the customer about the quality of the product they are eating.  
	
When addressed directly about the topic of edible insects, the FDA states that even if there is not a specific law that speaks about insects, the FDA does “have” regulations about this industry. This is because the FDA requires by law the following:
“All the food must be clean and wholesome (with no filth, pathogens, bacteria, toxins, etc.) and must be produced, packaged, stored and transported under sanitary conditions. Including a proper label of the content” 
	As a consequence they consider that there is a regulation, although not specific, about how to process the insects.  The broad statement gives too much space to different interpretations.  A situation that could be problematic in the future.  On the other hand, the breeding of insects can bring a lot of complex situations. As there is no clear regulations about it, the companies can decide to feed the insects with waste or low quality feed, therefore rendering a possibly not healthy insect. Also, there is no regulations about the workplaces or the farms and the beef farm regulations cannot be adjusted to insect ones. 
	What is clear is that the United States government has to start developing regulations focused on this emerging market. As there is no prohibition for neither the breeding nor the production of edible insects, the industry is going to thrive in the US. However, it is likely that there is going to be huge differences in quality and cleanliness between brands, as anyone is going to interpret the broad regulations to their best interest. 



*Nice article Iker! It definitely corroborates what I found so far: nothing is clear ^^. I made some slight changes in the form, but nothing important (you can check my changes in the history).*

*Just a remark: are you sure there are no law forbidding to rear animals for human consumption on wastes (especially insects? There is one in Europe -Marie* ** There is law requiring the protein levels, etc, etc on feed for animals. But, insects are not considered animals, so there is no legislation about it.**
