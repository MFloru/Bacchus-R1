####about us
Bacchus is the Roman God of wine and plentiness, agriculture and fertility of nature. We chose a Roman god, and not the Greek god Dyonisos, because the Greeks were the artists of ancient times whether the Romans were the engineers!

Our goal is to provide the world with a plentiness of food, delicious food. Just as the plentiness and the delicious wine Bacchus symbolizes. As engineers, we want to combine human innovation in agriculture with the use of the fertility of nature to make this happen.

###Why insects? (2 pages)
World food security

Benefits of insects

<p>In this modern era, hunger kills more people every year than AIDS, malaria, & tuberculosis combined (World Food Programme, 2015). As world hunger refers to the want or scarcity of food in a country (Oxford English Dictionary, 1971), The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that about 805 million people of the 7.3 billion people in the world were suffering from chronic undernourishment in 2012-2014. That means 1 in 9 people were suffering for that (World Hunger, 2015). </p>
<p>Regardless of the decreasing number of hungry people that can be seen in the table presented above, world hunger is still a major issue that needs a special attention. There are lots of things that people have done to help reduce the number. Most of them are by increasing the production rate in agriculture sector.</p>
<p>However is it true that the main reason of world hunger is because of we don’t grow enough food to feed everyone? It turns out the growth of global agriculture’s productive potential has so far been more than sufficient to exceed population growth (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2012). The reason of the world hunger is mostly because of poverty, because the poor people can’t afford the food.
The dependence of agriculture source of food is what makes the distribution of food produced uneven. Therefore, we need a new source of food that is reliable to support; or even better – substitute the common source of food.</p>
<h3 id="Why-insect">Why Insect</h3>
<p>From that concern we are fascinated with the idea of insect as a new-reliable source of food. This idea is also supported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, as quoted from bbc.com said that eating insect could help boost nutrition and reduce pollution; thus eating more insect could help fight world hunger (BBC, 2013). </p>
<p>As we know that consuming insect is still an unpopular idea especially in western country, a further exploration about edible insect will be a good call as it will provide more information and people will get to know it better.  </p>
<p>So, why insect? Regardless of its looks that most of people don’t fancy, insect as food is not only contain high nutrition (protein, vitamins and minerals) that can be found in fish and meat, but also way healthier as it contains less fat (as for the ratio). Harvesting insect is way easier than harvesting cows, pigs and sheep; they need less food to raise, emit fewer greenhouse gases, and by consuming insect we also help reduce pest insects without using any insecticides. Last but not least, farming insect can become a new form of business that can be done in the developing tropical countries (which usually suffered for poverty) where those insects mostly live.</p>
<p>Here are the brief explanations of the advantages of eating insects (Huls, et al., 2013)</p>
<p>1.	Environmental opportunities: the environmental benefits lie in the high feed conversion efficiency of insects. For example, crickets require only 2kg of feed for every 1 kg of body weight gain. Insect can be reared on organic side-streams (including human and animal waste) and can help reduce environmental contamination. It emits fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia, require significantly less land and water, and compared with mammals and birds, insect also pose less risk of transmitting zoonotic infections to humans, livestock and wildlife (although this topic needs further research).</p>
<p>2.	Nutrition for human consumption: insects are highly nutritious and healthy food source with high fat, protein, vitamin, fiber and mineral content. For example the composition of unsaturated omega-3 and six fatty acids in mealworms is comparable with that in fish, and the protein, vitamin and mineral content of mealworms is similar to that in fish and meat. </p>
<p>3.	Insect as animal feed: insect-based feed products could have a similar market to fishmeal and soy, which are presently the major components used in feed formulae for aquaculture and livestock. </p>
<p>4.	Processing: insects are often consumed as whole but can also be processed into granular or paste forms. Extracting proteins, fat, chitin, minerals and vitamins is also possible. At present such extraction processes are too costly and will need to be further developed to render them profitable and applicable for industrial use in the food and feed sectors. </p>
<p>5.	Livelihood and economic improvement: insect gathering and rearing as minilivestock at the household level or industrial scale can offer important livelihood opportunities for people in both developing and developed countries. It also can offer employment and cash income, for example in developing countries in Southern and Central Africa and Southeast Asia, the process of insect gathering, rearing and processing is easily within reach of small-scale enterprises. </p>

###Key drivers to grow the insect industry (4 pages)
####Acceptance among western people to eat insects (1 page)
Let us put the currently observed Western disgust towards insect consumption in a historical prospect.

Agriculture was born in the Fertile Crescent, a region located in western Asia, ten thousand years ago before quickly spread to Europe. From a nomad hunter-gatherer way of life, men started to domesticate plant and animals to secure their food sources, thus became sedentary.

The domesticated animals were mainly large ones, not only because they were present in these regions but also because they could supply wool, leather, warmth, milk and strength (for farming or transportation) in addition to meat; what insects cannot.
Moreover, the seasonality of insects -especially in these non-tropical regions where most of them hibernate- added to the uncertainty of their supply made them an unreliable source of food for Westerners, and especially urban areas.

In parallel, along with the plant domestication, insects became a pest able to destroy entire harvests. This is one of the reasons why Westerners culturally associate all insects with nuisances. Examples such as mosquitos, ticks, fleas or flies able to transmit illnesses to humans; or termites eating the wood of their constructions only deepened Westerners’ aversion against insects. Not to mention the shapes of insects, seen as monstrous and repulsive by many a European.

Westerners also rapidly associated insect consumption with some primitive behavior inherited from the hunting-gathering times, therefore despicable.

Because of this historical and cultural background, disgust is the first reaction of many a European when suggested to eat insects.
But just as every social norm, it can be changed within some time.

####Legislative security (1 page)
In many countries, there is no regulation for insects as food and feed. This is one of the big barriers to insect mass-production. There are no international guidelines provided by the Codex Alimentaris (a database providing international reference standards for food and feed) either.

On the opposite, there are laws on maximum permissive levels of insect contamination in food products for humans such as grains.

In EU, edible insects are considered as Novel Food because they were not consumed to a significant degree by Europeans before May 15, 1997. Therefore, the European Novel Food Regulation (EC n° 258/97) applies, restricting their trade as long as their safety has not been investigated.

However, European countries such as Belgium overcame this regulation, authorizing 10 species to be commercialized.

#####Production costs barrier (1 page)
Are quite prohibitive at the moment because the industry in not mature yet -no automatized process, so needs lots of human labor.


###Focus on mealworms
####Presentation

<h4 id="-Mealworm-"><em>Mealworm</em></h4>

<p>There are thousands of insect’s species around the world and more than 1900 species have reportedly been used as food. Globally, the most common insects consumed are beetles (Coleoptera). This is not surprising given that the group contains about 40% of all known insect species. The insect family has a great number in terms of species. The figure below shows the number of insect species, by order, consumed worldwide (Huls, et al., 2013).</p>
<p> As can be seen in the graph above, the difference of the insect quantity consumed worldwide is quite big in the coleopteran order. This brings an interest for us to narrow our focus on coleopteran order, which is beetle. Another interesting fact occurs as we learn more about beetle; it turns out mealworm that is already quite famous as an exotic food, is a larval form of beetle.  There are quite numbers of information and articles about mealworm as food, which indicating that some people already acknowledge it as food; thus it brings positive advantage to our projects. Not only mealworm wins in quantity and fame, it is also contain high nutrition (dried): 46-53% protein, 28% fat, 6% fiber, 5% water, environmentally safe, simple production process (we believe so because it’s small and have no hard shell like beetle), and better yet- have a short life cycle. This is why we believe that mealworm will be a best candidate for a further study. </p>

Pictures of mealworms and data about them
Are already accepted in many cultures (Mexico, Asia...)
Already produced at industrial scale in some countries - namely China
*I think we shall also go back on all the aspects -nutritive, health issues, production -cycle life, ecological impact in more details specifically for mealworms...*

####Academic research in mealworms nutritional properties (1 page)
As quantified on the table below, mealworms offer slightly less protein than beef but also less fat. The levels are comparable, however, which make them a perfect alternative to beef meat.
Regarding minerals, mealworms contain more magnesium than beef, and comparable values of calcium, sodium, iron, zinc and other minerals. 
Mealworms have globally higher vitamin content than beef, except for vitamin B12. It is to be noted that neither beef nor mealworms are significant sources of Vitamin A

###Mealworm flour as a solution (2 pages)
The reason why we choose to focus on one type of insect flour is that it adresses some of the key drivers : Acceptance in the West by disguising the original shape of an insect, standarization in order to make it possible to use it in lots of products and industrialization to lower the cost of insect food.

###Market
####Impact assessment of mealworm flour (X pages)


The current market for insects in the West is very small. The customers mainly consist of early adopters, foodies, people who like to try new or exotic things and alike. Also, it starts to become popular at a party snack. Because the market is that new, analyzing the current customers and markets says very little about the future market insects as food can seize. We believe, to get an idea of the possible impact of insects as food, we should look at current similar markets where insects, and more in particular insect flour, can be a substitute. For these markets, we want to get an idea of the economic, ecologic and health impact insects can have. We identified the following markets insects can possibly substitute:

for humans :

Meat substitutes

Sports supplements

Burgers

Sausages

Snacks

Meat in general

for animals :

Chicken feed

Fish feed

Pet food

#####For human consumption
######Meat Substitutes

Meat substitutes in the West are products that are related to meat in terms of taste and nutritional value, but with plant based proteins as the main ingredient. Sustainability and health concerns are the main reasons to eat these products. Therefore, while the market was originally mainly intended for vegetarians, now the average health conscious urban citizen becomes the target. With the apparent health and ecological impact insects can have, it is very plausible that insects will be a viable alternative for the meat substitutes market.

In 2013, this market had an estimated size of 3.2 billion $ worldwide. Today, 80 % of the market is soy based(MarketsAndMarkets Analysis). The main products are tofu, tempeh, seitan and quorn. Lots of small players compete in this market. The 5 biggest players are : Quorn Foods Ltd. (U.K.), Blue Chip Group (U.S.), Vbites Foods (U.K.), Amy's Kitchen Inc. (U.S.), and Cauldron Foods (U.K.) (PR Newswire). Market Analysts believe the market will grow with a CAGR of 4.4 to 6.4% up to 6.4 billion $ in 2019 (MarketsAndMarkets Analysis & RTS Resource). However, Western market analysts completely underestimate the size of the Chinese market, where tofu is a mainstream part of the diet. The tofu market alone was worth 11 billion $ in 2014 in China and has been growing with a CAGR of 20% a year during the last 5 years. This growth is not expected to slow down as domestic demand is still increasing (IBISWorld).

In the USA, tofu sells for about 4 $/kg . Vegie sausages sell for 12 $/kg and vegie burgers sell for about 6 $/kg (Indiana Soybean Board).

######Sports supplements

Sports supplements is quite a big market encompassing all bars, powders, drinks and alike that people eat or drink in addition to their normal diet to help their sport performance. Historically, the main customers of this market were young male adults wanting to grow their muscles faster after power workouts. However, more and more this market is becoming diversified and targets now all kinds of people who are doing sports to improve their health. Important in these products is that they contain exact amounts of  the additional nutrition people want. This means a simple insect powder would probably not be able to become a resource for this market. But, if it is possible to extract the proteins and omega 3 and 6 fatty acids insects are rich of, they could become a resource for this industry.

Studying what analysts think about the size of this market gives some useful insights. In 2007, BCC Research forecasted that the total market size would be 91.8 billion $ in 2013(BCC Research). In 2011, GIA estimated that the market would reach 67,1 billion $ in 2017 while in a recent report they forecast a size of 61 billion $ in 2020(Global Industry Analysts). It is clear that analysts tend to believe this market will grow way faster than it actually does. Also, almost 95% of this market is sports drinks, a category insect powder probably can't be an input for.

#####For animal consumption
Insects as a resource for animal consumption is a more mature market than insects for human consumption. The main markets are pet food, chicken feed and fish feed. Still, an exploration of this market is useful to estimate the gap between the current state and the potential of insects for animal consumption. Also, looking at industrial practices of companies producing insects for animal consumption can reveal valuable information for the production process for human consumption.  And you are better aware of these companies, as they can become future competitors!

######Pet food

The developed world accounts for more than 70% of the pet food market, for 90% existing of dog- and catfood(PMMI). However, with insects in mind, we should not forget about more exotic pets, who already eat large quantities of insects for their diets nowadays. It is a slowly growing market with a worldwide market size between 60 and 70 billion $ (GIA, Transparancy market research, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, PMMI).
The market is mainly dominated by a couple of big players : Mars, Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive, Procter&Gamble, Del Monte Foods(Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada).

An important market trend in the pet food market is the humanization of pets. Lots of people regard their pets almost as human beings, part of their family. This reflects in the market, where the same trends as in the human food market are seen : a trend towards healthy, organic and sustainable food. Also, in the USA, most customers expect that their pet food is made in the USA and not outsourced to production facilities in developing countries. These trends have both positive and negative implications for an companies who want to start producing insects for food on industrial scale. The trend towards healthy and ecological food can affect insects positively, if proper marketed. The trend towards local production can shield them from low cost competition. This competition can be severe, for example, in China, the company HaoCheng Mealworm Inc. is already processing insects on a vast industrial scale. On the other hand, the humanification of pets also raises questions about the acceptance of people to feed their pets insects(petfoodindustry). Will people who don't want to eat insects themselves feed their pets insects?
