Given the trend on population increase, the Earth will be inhabited by more than 10 billion people for the year 2100. All this population will need sources of food to satisfy their nutrient requirements. Considering that to produce 1 kg of beef 27 kg of CO2 are released into the air r(12 for pork and 6 for chicken). The producing of meat is no sustainable and therefore there should  be alternatives to meet this needs.  Our proposal is to use mealworms as a substitute  for meat. Mealworms have higher content on protein and less content on fat than meat. They require less space for breeding and processing and their ecological footprint make them a sustainable food source. They face challenges in legal and social  aspects, but we believe that in mealworms lies a big opportunnity that has to be seized

*It would be helpful and faster if instead of comments, just propose the changes directly and comment on the bottom what changes were made*

This is the source of the CO2 impact btw
