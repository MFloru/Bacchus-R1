People, if you visit Github there and go to our repository, click the setting buttn on the right part of the screen. Scroll down to find the "Publish webpage", if you click it you can modify our static webpage. The designs are a little bit dull but there is not much options to choose. We need to decide which information we are going to publish on the main page. I am not sure how to put images there, as the easiest way would be uploading the logic model picture/brochure. Please take a peep and place the information we require there.
