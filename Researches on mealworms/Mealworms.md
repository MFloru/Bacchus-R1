|**MEALWORMS** |

* After reviewing all the information I can report the following highlights that are very notable about mealworms:*
*Mealworms are the larvae form of the Dark Beetle; they are widesrpead used as pet food (for reptiles) and usually are bred in petstores or pet owners houses*
*The female beetle can lay 500 eggs per time and they have a life expectancy around three months*
*Some chemicals (or cold) can be used to keep the larvaes as worms  and stop the metamorphosis into pupae*
*They are said to have a delicious flavor compared to other insects, and chefs already prepare meatballs and pattys with them*

*Conclusion: I strongly think that Mealworms is the way to go*

That's the as far as I know largest producer of mealworms in the world. And believe, this is a huge factory, not a startup anymore. However, I still believe people in the West won't trust a Chinese mealworm manufacturer that fast, so still possibilities to grow them in Europe or USA. Can deliver dried mealworms at 10 $/kg.
