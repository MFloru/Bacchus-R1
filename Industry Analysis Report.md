<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>Bacchus is the Roman God of wine and plenty ness, agriculture and the fertility of nature. We chose a Roman god, and not the Greek god Dyonisos, as the Greeks were the artists of ancient times, but the Romans were the engineers!</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide the world with a plentyness of food, delicious food. Just as the plentyness and the delicious wine Bacchus stands for. And as engineers, we want to combine human innovation in agriculture with the use of the fertility of nature to make this happen.</p>
